The reconditioned computers are intended for use by activist groups in Amazonian villages lacking electricity or reliable phone lines. The goal is to establish free computer labs in nearby urban centers, as many cities already have commercial internet cafes but their hourly rate of around a day's wage for most of the population makes them inaccessible. The IMC activists plan to transport these computers to Guayaquil, Ecuador's main port city by the end of September. Since the computers are not being sold in Ecuador and are being transferred from an American nonprofit to a local one, they will avoid international shipping duties. This initiative exemplifies what you call 'real free trade', as stated by Eddie Nix. Thanks for sharing, MarkoffCharney."

This could be one of the biggest setbacks for the fight against obesity since supersize fries. Across the country, thousands of these gooey, calorie-laden snack cakes are being devoured at county fairs and restaurants. For instance, Rocky Mullen, who sells deep-fried, cream-filled Twinkies for us, reported that people drive for hours just to sample his Twinkies. As if Twinkies aren't sweet enough already, vendors such as Mr. Mullen add chocolate or berry sauce and sprinkle powdered sugar on top. With Hostess, the company that produces the snack, promoting deep-fried Twinkies at state and county fairs, a captive audience of junk food enthusiasts has begun consuming them in large quantities between pig races and tractor pull competitions. After deep-frying, a Twinkie is estimated to contain approximately calories and grams of fat."

A noteworthy point she made is that, in today's context, diversity is no longer an option for record companies, especially the major labels. It seems they are clinging to their outdated business model, which is heavily reliant on blockbuster artists. \n\nThe Linux Journal has published an article quoting Steven Levy's July piece that sheds light on this issue. The article suggests that the record labels are taking such a rigid stance due to their desire to protect their internet-challenged business model. Their revenue primarily comes from top artists, and if the industry transitioned to a more diverse landscape with independent labels and artists thriving, it could potentially harm the major labels who would struggle to rally support for the next Britney Spears. \n\nThe evidence supporting this theory comes from the testimony of an RIAA-backed economist who addressed the government fee panel. This expert predicted that a significant downsizing in webcasting is unavoidable and beneficial because it will lead to market consolidation. In simpler terms, consolidation means fewer artists for promotion, resulting in less overall spending by the labels. A smaller playlist increases the likelihood that audiences will purchase something from that list since they may not find other options available."

This flexibility benefits producers but creates confusion for consumers who need to make sense of it all. In each domain, RSS feeds, foaf files, etc., there needs to be established best practices for clarity and consistency. We require more goal-oriented documentation rather than just reference or task-oriented documentation. The current documentation lacks a comprehensive overview and fails to answer broader questions in simple English. For example, the question 'Do I include personal information in my RSS feed?' is a goal-oriented question that requires a goal-oriented answer such as 'To link a foaf file to an RSS feed using this tool, insert this line at this specific location in your RSS feed with appropriate examples provided.'

This might be an opportune moment to quote a Zen saying about detachment, though my mind is currently too foggy to find it. Timothy, you've been exploring formats like ffkar (formerly known as sam), and Nicholas has already implemented it. However, Movable Type doesn't support outputting dates in Unix timestamp, which could be a barrier to widespread acceptance.

It's beneficial for individuals with an infinitely large database that can be queried infinitely fast by a schema-aware program.\n2.

Aaron, if Python data is giving you trouble or if you're tired of dealing with contortions to manage data, you might be interested in a module that can help you implement the pseudocode from your slides. TRAMP may be the solution for these needs.\n\nFor example, parsing FOAF files with this module can be done as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom tramp import Tramp\ntramp = Tramp()\ntramp.parse_file('your_foaf_file.rdf')\n```\n\nUsing XHTML authoring tools with XSLT to produce RDF syntax can be a bit tedious, but many people are willing and able to edit it by hand. However, RDF adds another layer of tedium that I find unmanageable.\n\nRegarding the obscure 'profile' attribute in HTML, you will find a cogent explanation of its use in my attached document.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"

They also performed an extensive ultrasound on my carotid arteries in my neck, which supply blood to my head. Fortunately, they were found to be clear of plaque and healthy. This is good news because it reduces the risk of a stroke. However, I was diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease, not general artery disease. While there isn't a lot that can be done about this condition, it's reassuring since there are treatments available for heart issues. Unfortunately, a small part of my heart isn't functioning optimally. The reasons could range from fixable to non-fixable. When I asked the doctor if this means I have less time to live or need to restrict my activities, he said no in both cases. So, it seems there's not much more to it than keeping a watch for recurring symptoms similar to those that hospitalized me in June. If they return, an angiogram and possibly an angioplasty might be necessary, but the chance of another bypass due to this issue is small, which is quite relieving."

Each tiffa carrier (the boxes used) is marked with a series of symbols identifying its originating and destination stations, as well as the specific address it needs to reach. After the carriers are collected, they're taken to the nearest railway station, sorted according to their destinations, and then redistributed to the correct street addresses and floors upon arrival at the destination station.

       "body": "It appears that many users are failing to grasp the essence of Phoenix, as evidenced by the feedback on Mozilla. Let me clarify a point: if you find Mozilla's current UI satisfactory, then it is evident that Phoenix is not intended for you. To help determine whether Phoenix aligns with your needs, I've prepared a quiz. For instance, the toolbar and sidebar are essential to my daily workflow, particularly when using Bugzilla. Do others universally use Bugzilla?\n\nThe sidebar is indispensable for me due to my screen resolution limitations. I require the flexibility to float and dock all panels, including splitters between them, to monitor web page progress for individual HTML panels and manage my email entirely within the sidebar. Auto-fill is not useful unless I can fill out pages of personal information automatically. Downloads should be organized in a tree view with progress meters visible in columns. Toolbars should be fully customizable, dockable to all four screen corners, floatable outside the window, and support custom commands. Additionally, they should allow me to edit existing buttons/commands, create my own toolbars, place toolbars on the same line, and edit the submenus and context menus of items including those on the menu bar. Lastly, Phoenix should offer capabilities beyond simply browsing my file system; it should also cook dinner, wash my car, walk my dog, do my taxes, mow my lawn, and be customizable to a reasonable extent.\n\nFurthermore, while composer should always be available within the browser, it should not be confined to a single location. Instead, I propose that composer options be scattered throughout the UI for ease of access. Regarding your concern about mail being part of the browser program, they are fundamentally different applications. However, Phoenix's UI will not be controlled by Netscape. This presents an opportunity for core Mozilla Navigator developers to construct their dream browser without having to cater to conflicting pressures from various factions within Netscape.\n\nLastly, Phoenix aims to provide a scalable solution. By implementing features as optional add-ons, users can customize the complexity of their browser according to their preferences, without being forced to accept geek features by default."

       "body": "The issue at hand concerns enabling different toolbar modes, a fundamental browser feature that has been absent from Navigator for years. Even simplified browsers like Chimera have this capability. Neil did commendable work on this and his code was finally implemented; however, it increased startup time and window loading slightly. As a result, it was rolled back due to Mozilla's strict policy against regressions. While this policy is beneficial in many ways, I believe it overlooks the point. There is a tendency when developing applications to add features with each new software version, but seldom do you see features removed. Over time, applications become increasingly bloated, relying on faster machines and more memory to function effectively. This email is a metaphorical illustration of this issue: as an elevator that stops at each floor, collecting more and more passengers (features), until it becomes too heavy and the support cable snaps, causing everyone to perish. We need to forcibly remove unnecessary features from Mozilla, replace them with essential ones, cull out failed features, and make certain they are not present in Mozilla. Furthermore, we should make more of the features optional plugins, allowing tech-savvy users with powerful machines to download them independently if desired. By actively combating bloat, we can eventually create an exceptional Mozilla browser."

However, it's important to remember that everyone may not have the same top ten problems with Mozilla. For instance, while I agree that the chrome structure is restrictive, we might differ on the proposed default configuration. Nevertheless, the need for customizable toolbars to address this issue seems agreed upon. On speed, reducing bloat by minimizing unnecessary UI and features can indeed improve performance. The text editing issue in Chimera, specifically the buggy, slow, and misbehaving textfield widget, you find to be its top usability problem. I concur with your assessment here. In terms of message display, there's no argument. Search functionality needs improvement, though it might not be in my top ten. The menu structure issue aligns with your blog post about separating apps, simplifying the menus would indeed make them more manageable. Migration is a problem, but I don't consider it one of the top ten facing Mozilla at this time. Regarding context menus, while MPT complains about two-click context menus, adhering to the conventions of the operating system seems sensible. Validation errors and preferences are less directly related to usability for the average user, but I understand your point that they could be higher on the list due to their complexity. Separating preferences for individual apps into unique dialogs would simplify things significantly, and reducing unnecessary preferences in the GUI is also advisable."

People may add excessive fields to their bug databases, making entering a bug like applying to Harvard, resulting in fewer bugs being reported. However, we understand that this request is specific and likely relevant only for a small percentage of bugs. Our initial thought is that the programmer or assignee could review the bug first, and if they believe it might be related to DLL versions, they can then request the necessary information from the originator. Similar concerns have been raised about adding fields for operating system version or other specific details, as this may lead to a reduction in the number of bug reports. If the bug is OS-dependent, this information can be included in the text description. However, searching for bugs that occur only on certain operating systems with custom fields isn't practical because not every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system. Our goal with a bug tracking database is to keep track of bugs efficiently rather than making it easy to find them.

In my blog, I highlighted two primary issues with installing Netscape: the absence of popup blocking and the intrusive advertising spam on the desktop and toolbars. I urged Netscape to address these problems, but they refused to listen. Now, take a look at this CNET highlight that points out the downside of Netscape - it displays AOL ads everywhere, doesn't allow you to turn off popup windows like Mozilla does, consumes excessive disk space, and more. Many other engineers at Netscape, as well as managers, shared my concerns and fought to rectify these problems; however, we consistently lost every battle. The simple truth is that the individuals in charge of Netscape's browser are incompetent; they either lack the understanding of how to create a good browser or simply don't care. Their engineers tell them what they are doing wrong, yet they fail to listen. Perhaps you will pay heed to the public opinion; after all, eWeek's article titled 'Netscape Shrivels Under Mozilla's Shadow' should be enough for you to take notice now.

In essence, software teams do not perform well when design or management are done in a different physical location than programming. I had personally experienced this in a past job where my direct manager was in Singapore, his manager in Hyderabad, and I had to communicate with the CEO for any management input during my working hours because both were awake at the same time. A good project team relies on numerous small interactions daily, as is common here at Fog Creek offices.

       "body": "Dear All, \n\nI wanted to clarify some points regarding my previous blog about the Parents Television Council (PTC) and their recent labeling of Buffy as the worst show on television for children. Firstly, I believe that Buffy is indeed inappropriate for children, but I have concerns about the PTC's motives and agenda. \n\nThe PTC has a clear goal beyond simply warning parents about the dangers of TV shows or video games. They advocate for designating the first hour of primetime as a family hour and for no offensive shows to air during that time. I disagree with this approach, as I don't believe it is the networks' responsibility to restrict the kind of content aired during any particular hour. \n\nPrime-time programming varies greatly; some shows are family-oriented, while others are not. However, there is no shortage of suitable content if parents and children wish to watch TV together during this hour. I believe it is the parents' responsibility to police their children's television viewing. If you don't want your kids watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer, then don't let them, but don't campaign for its removal or shifting to a late hour, which would only risk its cancellation. \n\nMoreover, the PTC seems to find shows offensive that are actually family-oriented. For instance, Malcolm in the Middle is considered inappropriate by the PTC, which I find surprising. The only shows they deem appropriate seem to be those that have been sanitized to fit their ultra-conservative agenda. This idea that all other shows should be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]"

Firstly, while the installed base of OS X is relatively small, it represents the majority of individuals purchasing new computers. Secondly, if OS X fails to gain traction, the Mac itself may become obsolete since its popularity isn't increasing significantly. Developing for the Macintosh can be compared to creating a website that only works on Netscape due to its limited market share. However, it's essential to consider that if your Windows product appeals to X% of users, you must appeal to X times more Mac users just to break even. While an emotional attachment to the Mac is understandable, when discussing investment opportunities, it's crucial to demonstrate how you plan to attract a significantly larger user base. This could be due to less competition in your category on the Mac, or if your product caters to a niche like graphics where Macs seem popular. However, it's important to recognize that Macs don't actually dominate the market in this area; they appear dominant only among elite graphics users in major cities. If your product requires compatibility with mixed environments, ensure it runs everywhere.

      "body": "I have just finished reading an article that I found quite amusing. The question it raises is intriguing: in almost every way, Mozilla seems to be a superior browser compared to Navigator, such as the fact that tabbed browsing, which allows you to have multiple web pages open in the same browser window and bookmark them all under one name, was available in Mozilla months before it became Netscape's 'best new feature'. When asked about this, Netscape admitted this is true, but they also mentioned that the engineer working on it for Mozilla is an ex-Netscape employee. It appears that this collaboration was intended to enhance general browsing usability for Netscape. However, I should clarify that when you mentioned 'Netscape employee', I assume you meant Apple employee and by 'intention of fostering general browsing usability for Netscape', you meant it was developed for Mozilla because I thought the multizilla extension was interesting. Here's a brief history of tabbed browsing: One night, I finally downloaded an extension called multizilla. I was particularly impressed with its feature called 'tabbed browsing'. After doing some research, I found a tabbed browser that embedded Wine (multizilla) but had two fundamental flaws that prevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree: first, it copied some features from Netcaptor, which might have raised concerns about copying some of Netcaptor's more obscure capabilities; second, the tab behavior wasn't encapsulated cleanly into a widget. I then developed a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time, doing it in a weekend and removing some of the geekier Netcaptor features while ensuring that the changes to other navigator files would be minimal. Once I established that it didn't degrade performance in the single tab case, I checked it in as an experiment. The response was overwhelming, but also filled with bugs. Initially, I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree, but Mozilla convinced me not to. I am glad they did because it turned out to be a good thing for all. Even with all the excitement and buzz surrounding the introduction of tabbed browsing in the engineering community and in Mozilla, Netscape seemed oblivious. Their marketing prioritized various non-essential tasks over tabbed browsing, ignoring its potential until the press raved about it. Now, I can't help but think that Netscape is repeating this mistake with popup blocking - introducing unnecessary complexity instead of focusing on simplicity. It's a pity when their engineers provide valuable suggestions and are ignored or dismissed, but they rush to address criticisms from sources like CNET."

In the latter case, the argument was that the ability to make full copies of a broadcast work was not considered fair use in terms of copyright. It was illegal enough that the VCR should be kept off the market. However, the Supreme Court ruled that the technology is legal if it has substantial non-infringing uses. This principle is currently under attack. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) makes it illegal to defeat a copyright measure such as the regionalization system for DVDs.

These models, predating the Antikythera Mechanism, were later used by Claudius Ptolemy in the second century AD. \n\nInterestingly, it's speculated that an upper layer of mechanism may have been lost, which could have modeled the motions of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn - the three other planets known at the time. Thus, the device might have had the capability to predict the positions of the known celestial bodies for any given date with a reasonable degree of accuracy using bronze pointers on a circular dial featuring the constellations of the zodiac.\n\nBest regards,"

Instead of accepting the occasional minor infringements and focusing on the major pirates, they are labeling every act of infringement and some things that aren't infringements at all as acts of piracy or theft. Saying it doesn't make it so."

Preliminary findings from the hearings indicate that artists are prohibited by contract from showing royalty statements to third parties, including managers, lawyers, consultants, etc., who could assist them in getting paid. However, it seems that this may not always be the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the initiative for artists' rights, claimed that Cary Sherman, chief counsel for the RIAA, said in an interview that RIAA members, the major labels, would sue any artist who broke ranks and shared information with the committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but supported by others present, including Don Henley. In a bold move, Henley openly dared his record company to sue him for bringing his royalty statements to the hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for 'Hell Freezes Over', which demonstrated that even though his contract stipulated no more than a reserve on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had withheld more than that for eleven pay periods, approximately three years. Additionally, it showed that despite his contract stating 'no free goods' in Europe, they had deducted charges for free goods from Europe."

However, voice time is another story, more on that later. Another reason I like the Sidekick is that it was designed for and will be marketed towards a very different audience compared to its competitors.

Google's recent update seems to be following a similar pattern. The blogging community has been adversely affected by these changes, for instance, my website's ranking was significantly impacted. It appears that the updates are aimed at stopping two specific practices, namely selling ads based on certain keywords and a technique known as 'Google bombing'.\n\nApparently, Google is now cross-checking link text with the linked site and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not match the linked site. This effectively brings an end to 'Google bombing', as searching for phrases like 'go to hell' no longer leads to search results related to the phrase 'talentless'. However, it is unclear whether Google is actively penalizing sites that were participating in these practices.\n\nUnfortunately, the adjustments made to stop these techniques have resulted in a wide range of collateral damage, especially for medium-to-large websites that had been adhering to all best practices regarding page structure, link structure, accessibility, and overall honest work. The WebmasterWorld forums are filled with complaints about these changes.\n\nIn the midst of confusion, there have been suggestions that Google might no longer be indexing alt text in images; however, this is not accurate. A search for 'diveintomarkorg' finds my entry from July, which is only mentioned in an image's alt text. Google's search results, in general, seem to have degraded significantly in many key areas, with spam sites, doorway pages, and cloaking attempts now appearing more frequently in top spots.\n\nThe forums are full of examples like this, such as a search for 'reservation' bringing up an empty hotel reservation company as the first result. This does not seem helpful or relevant to the average US-based consumer, given that Google is aware of my location based on my IP address.\n\nMany people in the forums are suggesting that Allthewebcom has better search results overall. For instance, a comparison between 'do' and 'diveintomarkorg' shows more relevant search results from Allthewebcom."

Maintain a lowkey demeanor: Avoid anger as it will only escalate the situation.\n3. Approach them directly: Get out of your vehicle, walk up to them, make eye contact, but not in an avoidant way. Offer a friendly greeting and a handshake.\n4. Act like a used car salesman: Be charismatic and engaging, just as you would when selling a car. Always carry cigarettes and offer one to help break the ice.\n5. Engage in small talk: These guards are often bored, located in remote areas, and may not have interacted with many people for hours.

       "body": "Throughout October, the Berkeley Mathematical Sciences Research Institute is hosting Cinemath - a series dedicated to mathematics in film. In this avant-garde subset of Cinemath, we delve into films that have been constructed using mathematical concepts, both basic and intricate. These strategies include geometric permutations, musical frameworks, and even topography. Early pioneers like Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann, who created some of the earliest avant-garde films by manipulating abstract images, are among those showcased. Today, visual music and motion graphics, made possible by digital graphics, continue to thrive. Anthony McCall's film performances, such as 'Line Describing a Cone,' for instance, transform geometric shapes that viewers can literally step into. We also highlight films by pioneers of machine-generated and computer-produced animation, including Norman McLaren, James and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek, as well as works by contemporary animators who use the computer to create or pattern images. Larry Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis, Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish Lawder utilize the frame as their creative tool for editing patterns.

This combination causes your computer to intercept every packet sent out on your wireless segment and respond with a rejected message. Therefore, it is recommended that users either turn off their firewall while using etherpeg, or vice versa. As for the unpredictable nature of networking, it can indeed be a stern mistress.

Therefore, even if you decide to change where to extract files on the last screen, you can simply backtrack and make the alteration. All the old files overwritten are put back, all Windows accounts created are uncreated, all permissions granted are ungranted, the SQL database is unmade, and so on. While the end result is a robust setup program, it might be considered excessive if time allows, I will provide more insights about what I learned.

Glenn Fleishman took extensive notes throughout the discussion. \n\nThe main points revolved around the idea that obscurity can serve as a tool. For instance, many books published in the US are forgotten after their initial publication. Piracy, rather than being widespread, tends to occur in rare cases and is more like theft for most publications. Publishers often put books that an author has spent years creating on shelves for just three months if they don't sell, and the author has no rights during this period, with the publisher retaining rights until the book goes out of print. In essence, oblivion is the fate of most pirated materials. \n\nPeople generally respect creators' rights, making piracy a marginal act. The publishing industry may undergo changes, but it will not disappear entirely. Early on in the web, the idea was that everyone could be a publisher, and the way websites interact with publishers is similar to how book publishers try to secure placement and position in bookstores. \n\nPublishing can be seen as aggregation, and people will reemerge as publishers. The question remains whether Hollywood will become the publishers of the future or if someone else will take on that role. As users continue to adopt programs like Kazaa, media companies may adapt, but if changes are hardcoded into law, we could be stuck with certain mistakes for a long time."

This restriction on access during work hours might be justifiable given the nature of her job, but let's move past corporate politics and focus on the fascinating story behind this symbol. The tilde is a common command-line shorthand for navigating directories, leading to one's home directory with 'cd' or another user's home directory with 'cd username'. However, in macOS, it points to their public file sharing directory when web sharing is enabled. This historical background gives rise to the use of tildes in URLs to denote personal pages today. \n\nI find Jukka to be an expert on this topic, and he has written extensively about the tilde, including a treatise that ironically contains a tilde in its URL. The tilde was initially used as an alternate for the '~' character, later evolving into a general-purpose character with various geeky uses. Jukka confirms that it originated as an overline replacement, but somewhere along the line, it became associated with the Spanish 'ñ'. \n\nDespite extensive research, I could not find definitive information about the origins of the tilde or the acronym used in the watershed meeting where its use was proposed in the USA. Its role as a synonym for 'home' or 'personal' websites can be traced back to its use on Usenet, and it became popular in web servers around the same time to provide individual users with their own sites."

Thus, the question arises: why don't cab companies ensure timely or any pick-ups at all? The reason lies in labor laws: if a company orders a driver to perform a specific task, it creates an employer-employee relationship. However, by outsourcing work to independent contractors, cab companies can avoid costly expenses such as disability and social security taxes.

This system can operate at pressures up to atmospheric levels, temperatures as low as -20 degrees Celsius, and with vibrational accelerations reaching hundreds of Gs. The key feature is a high-speed bidirectional communication link that allows for the evaluation of drilling system parameters such as azimuth, inclination, pressure, temperature, loads, and vibration almost instantaneously. Additionally, it can provide information on rock characteristics near the drill bit. This new technology may also make previously unattainable feats such as collecting high-resolution seismic data at the drill bit possible. This could enable operators to steer the drill bit more precisely towards oil and gas-bearing sweet spots and away from less productive areas, thereby increasing the efficiency of oil and gas wells and reducing the number of wells needed to produce a reservoir."

Since our inception of discussions with the Taliban for pipeline permissions, we even flew Mullah Omar to Texas in an attempt to persuade him. After it became apparent that this approach wouldn't succeed, we resorted to threats and small-scale attacks for a year prior to the official invasion, which was already planned two months before the attacks. The timing of our military intervention provided a convenient cloak for their plans. The Afghanistan President we installed, Karzai, who had worked for the oil company Unocal and previously focused on the pipeline rather than nation rebuilding, presides over an inoperable pipeline due to its excessive cost and vulnerability to sabotage by warlords. Pakistan is believed to harbor Osama bin Laden, who funded attacks but did not execute them. It's more likely that Islamic Jihad from Egypt perpetrated the attacks. If we genuinely aimed to combat terrorism, we should have targeted the real perpetrators. If our goal was to curb anti-American sentiment, we should have confronted Saudi Arabia and Pakistan instead. Our military intervention created an opportune escape route for bin Laden and failed to stabilize Afghanistan, leaving it as devastated as ever. Tragically, our government exploited the public's grief, naivety, and thirst for justice and vengeance. They capitalized on this moment not for the greater good but to enrich themselves and their associates, putting the rest of us at risk.

For instance, this spec might include setting limits on data values only to remove them later, requiring certain elements but making them optional, thus causing unknown numbers of parsers worldwide to malfunction. It might also encourage the use of entity-encoded HTML in its most important element, increasing security risks and unpredictable display for the end user. Furthermore, it might ignore years of standards work in other fields, committing egregious sins such as defining a 'guid' element that wasn't a GUID and using an obsolete date format that couldn't easily be sorted by date. Its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core namespace without telling anyone or documenting them, making it resistant to DTD schema or validation of any kind. After years of worldwide deployment, it might completely reverse its 'addwhateveryouwant' extensibility rules in favor of namespaces which the spec would neither define nor elaborate on. After adopting namespaces, it would fail to deprecate any existing elements semantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use and would also fail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the same thing in two different ways, thus ensuring mass confusion among producers and inconsistent behavior across consumers.

The user suggests that instead of making the setup process reversible, it should collect all the information from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end. However, the user points out several reasons why this approach might not be beneficial: \n1. There's always a possibility that some step in the middle of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program should back out the steps that were already done. The number of things that can fail is not insignificant.\n2. It's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages after they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBugz setup process, we prompt the user to create an account for FogBugz. The account creation could fail for various reasons, some of which cannot be predicted before trying to create the account.\n3. It's better to tell the user about this problem right away so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it.\n4. Even if you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part of the work that was done before creating the account, otherwise, you've left their system in an indeterminate state.\n5. The user also mentions that they need to write code to create the account and delete the account in case something later fails. They suggest that it might as well be called on this page of the wizard where a useful error message can be displayed.\n6. The user questions why everything should be done at the end, suggesting that some things, like granting privileges or stopping/starting processes, need to be reversible. For instance, to upgrade FogBugz without requiring a reboot, we have to shut down a few processes that might have been keeping FogBugz files pinned down.\n7. The user also mentions that they used MFC for their code, and even though Delphi might be more productive, they are more familiar with MFC and VC.\n8. The user suggests that the setup process reduces tech support costs by delighting customers, making upgrades less daunting, and improving reviews."

Thank you.\n\nLast week, I ran 5 miles, and even taking into account my mistake this week, I'm concerned that I might be turning into a runner.

This comment weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative years, so it is with some embarrassment that I admit I am becoming a runner.\n\nBecoming a runner isn't complex; it essentially involves running. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only manage around the block, do it today. Tomorrow, you'll find yourself running around two blocks. Next week, you'll find you can run a mile, and eventually, one day, you'll be a runner.\n\nIt's not complicated; you just need to run, run, and run until one day you realize that shoes are important and your old sneakers aren't suitable for running. You'll buy new shoes, run, and run some more. Later, you'll learn about the importance of stretching, different running surfaces, and how many miles a pair of shoes should last, but don't worry about all that now - just run."

       "body": "Lisa Pierce, a Maine resident who hit a moose with her car on November and lost the right to claim its meat, is now embroiled in a dispute with the York County Sheriff's Department over compensation. Pierce's freezer at home contains ground beef, roasts, frozen vegetables, French fries, and popsicles, but not the moose meat she is owed. According to Pierce, the deputy who arrived at the scene thought he was doing her a favor, but Pierce disagrees. The law states that a big game carcass caught by a vehicle during an accident belongs to the person who hits it, provided a law enforcement officer is called and the vehicle is damaged. This law may not be well-known to many Mainers, especially during this peak time of deer versus car accidents, as animals in their mating season come out of the woods. Last year, there were numerous cases of vehicles and deer colliding on Maine roads, and accidents involving moose. Farm-grown deer meat can retail for up to $10 per pound in stores, while a butchered or dressed moose, which cannot be bought or sold anywhere in Maine, can produce hundreds of pounds of food. This law has been abused since its inception, with officers occasionally issuing summonses to drivers for intentionally killing a moose with a car. Hitting a moose, even at slow speeds, is no laughing matter; large adult moose can weigh up to 1,600 pounds and stand over 6 feet tall. Their bulk, which is above the hood level of most cars, often causes their bodies to crash through windshields during collisions. These accidents damage vehicles, the people inside, and sometimes result in fatalities. Pierce feels cheated by the situation, as her car was totaled on the morning of the accident. She was taking her two children and a neighbor's son to school in her Dodge Dynasty when she hit the moose. Pierce is aware of the law, but due to being transferred to the hospital before she could deal with the animal, she was unable to claim it until later that day. When she inquired, she was told the deputy on the scene gave the fully-racked bull moose to a neighbor who showed up with a tractor. Pierce's neighbor subsequently offered her the moose for $50, but when she contacted the Attorney General's office on November 2nd to complain about the deputy giving her moose away, the neighbor's price had increased to $150 for the cost of butchering pounds of meat. When Pierce called York County Chief Deputy Maurice Ouellette to complain that she should be compensated for the moose because it was the officer's fault that she did not have it, Ouellette told her he could not give her cash and the best he could do was to give her the next moose struck in York County. At this point, the issue became one of not wanting the moose but wanting money. Ouellette said a similar conversation with York County Sheriff Phil Cote left Pierce enraged, and she now feels the issue has gone beyond the moose. Other officials are not surprised by the circumstances that brought Pierce to this point; it is ultimately the officer's discretion as to who gets the animal.

       "body": "The enclosed material originates from Martin Gardner's book, 'Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science: Revised and Expanded Edition', published by Dover Publications Inc., New York City. Bill Bennetta discusses common traits of pseudoscientists. Firstly, these individuals typically work in near complete isolation, lacking productive interactions with fellow researchers. The modern crank claims this self-imposed isolation is due to the prejudice of established scientific groups against new ideas. However, they generally do not submit their findings to recognized journals and are often rejected when they do. This isolation is strengthened by a tendency towards paranoia. Five ways in which the sincere pseudoscientist may exhibit these paranoid tendencies include: considering themselves a genius, regarding colleagues as ignorant blockheads, insulting opponents, believing themselves unjustly persecuted and discriminated against, and focusing attacks on the greatest scientists and best established theories. When Newton was the leading name in physics, eccentric works were violently anti-Newton. Today, with Einstein being the symbolic authority, a crank theory of physics is likely to attack Einstein in the name of Newton. They often write in a complex jargon, using terms and phrases they themselves have coined. Terry W Colvin from Sierra Vista, Arizona, USA, contributes to journals he himself may edit, and publishes books only when he or his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed privately.

This search engine called 'Planet Search' displays a screen called 'Live Query', which shows updated samples of what people around the world are typing into their search engines in various languages such as English, Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Japanese, Korean, French, Dutch, Italian, etc. The scrolling terms represent thoughts from someone somewhere with an internet connection. Google collects these queries every day from over 100 countries and updates its databases millisecond by millisecond. It's intriguing to note that despite the geographic and ethnic diversity of the world, people are spending a significant amount of time thinking about similar things or topics such as celebrities, current events, products, and computer downloads. Interestingly, Google can feel the reverberations of events immediately, whether they be of a serious nature like earthquakes or more trivial like the name of Carol Brady from The Brady Bunch. The data reflects patterns but doesn't always explain them, creating a paradox. The most intriguing part is understanding why these surges in interest occur.

Lt Col Michael Humm, Pentagon spokesman, confirmed that the incident occurred on Wednesday and that the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) in Colorado Springs, CO is continuing to investigate the reported contrail. The concern lies in the possibility that it could have indicated the presence of an unauthorized jet aircraft in or approaching U.S. airspace, especially in the aftermath of the Sept 11 attacks. A contrail is created by vapor from a jet engine in the presence of cold air. Lt Cmdr Curtis Jenkins, a NORAD spokesman, mentioned that no new information has been developed since the initial report at PM EST on Wednesday. NORAD is reviewing data from its tracking radars for evidence. The Pentagon statement said that NORAD received unverified reports of what appeared to be a contrail of unknown origin initially in the vicinity of the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean, which was later reported over Florida and Indiana. However, no further sightings were reported, and the contrail was never verified by visual or radar contact. Paul Turk, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman, said he is aware of the reports but referred all questions to NORAD. It's unclear who reported the initial sighting over the Caribbean or who requested NORAD to launch fighter jets from which military bases they were scrambled. Jenkins added that they don't necessarily judge or second-guess when a request comes to them to investigate a contrail. Meanwhile, reports of a ball of fire streaking across the sky early Thursday had people throughout the northwest calling radio and television stations, which was believed to be a meteor shower caused by a Russian rocket body reentering Earth's atmosphere around AM. The U.S. Strategic Command in Omaha, NE and NORAD confirmed a Russian rocket fell back to Earth but gave no further details. Copyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Mr. Wallace died in Toledo, Washington, on November, having been ill for some time. He was a resident at a Toledo rest home. \n\nIt was during his company's construction work in Bluff Creek, California, from August to October, that one of his employees, Jerry Crew, found tracks of a large human-like foot. These discoveries, under the instructions of taxidermist Bob Titmus, led to the first plaster casts of a footprint from this hairy upright creature, later known as Bigfoot. \n\nThe photograph of Jerry Crew with the giant plaster of paris foot imprint gained widespread attention, marking a revolutionary shift from regional stories of Sasquatch to today's global awareness of Bigfoot. Following the publicized Crew finds, Wallace and his brother claimed other Bigfoot activity around their construction site. Wallace said he found tracks and droppings of Bigfoot. \n\nThroughout his life, Mr. Wallace was involved with local tales of hairy giants. He was often associated with pranks, carved fake Bigfoot feet, dubious photographs, and films. However, many Bigfoot hunters and researchers saw him as merely a spinner of fanciful tall tales. \n\nDespite this, Mr. Wallace contributed to the mystery of Bigfoot through his stories in publications like Strange Magazine and indirectly to Fate Magazine. He relished keeping his name in the limelight of the Bigfoot mystery. \n\nIn March, Mr. Wallace offered a million dollars to the first person who could bring him a live baby Bigfoot, claiming he had tracked Bigfoot for forty years. He expressed his desire to raise a young Sasquatch to adulthood, planning to care for and respect it, and even train it to ride around with him in his pickup truck and help out with chores on his ranch. Unfortunately, no one came forth with a baby Bigfoot. \n\nRay Wallace added an intriguing, mostly harmless storytelling element to the otherwise often serious pursuit of Bigfoot. His friends, such as Ray Crowe, director of the International Bigfoot Society, enjoyed Mr. Wallace's tales. \n\nRay Wallace was laid to rest at the Lone Hill Cemetery in Toledo, Washington, on November.

Your evolution during social interactions with your wife's associates, whom I refer to as 'Jethro-like,' might be confusing. Once forced to mingle with a husband who boasted about his connections to the famous, I found myself becoming more and more detached, using phrases like 'heehaw yall' and 'you done talked to him.' My counterpart never seemed to notice my regression, even as hair sprouted from my knuckles, my forehead contracted, my eyebrows merged, and I started grunting. Fortunately, my wife intervened before I did an impersonation of Moonwatcher with the chicken bones left from dinner. Regression can be a wonderful curative. Truth to the rumor, I scratched my armpit. Unsubscribe me from this group."

However, reminiscing about stage managing 'The Crucible' during senior year, where Becky Miller's father watched his little girl in the play and our male lead fell off the stage, seems to be more about your particular experiences rather than a direct comparison to my achievements. It is understandable that those who envy your success might find this a bit challenging. Nevertheless, I prefer not to diminish my own accomplishments. This year alone, I have had fourteen stories published and fifteen more are scheduled for next year, with a strong critical reception and my first collection due out in the spring. I am indeed blessed. Despite not having a film deal that pays per hour more than what I will make in a lifetime of short fiction, I count my blessings. By the way, I do believe Becky Miller drives a nicer car than me. Let's get back to work on the 'Megafelid Cranial Capacity' story. New stories like 'Story Words Daily', 'Microfiction coming soon at Teeth Party', 'The Mad Hater and the Dorkmouse', 'Spirits Blocking the Night Tale', 'Bones Dec', 'Jack's House: Strange Horizons (Jan)', 'One is All Alone: Strange Horizons (Jan)', 'You Want Candy: As of Yet Untitled (Feb)', and 'Walking Backward through the Countries of Life: Hour of Pain (Feb)' are on their way.

This change is due to fewer fires occurring at night; however, the majority of fatalities in fires occur during this period. The recent deaths during the firefighters' strike underscored this trend, with over half of these incidents happening in areas currently covered by retained crews who were not on strike. It is worth noting that a current requirement for being in a retained crew is living and working within one mile of the station, and it remains unclear how this will be applied to whole-time firefighters. A friend of mine, a station officer in Hampshire, lives miles away from his station, which raises questions about their ability to respond to night calls, especially considering that many inner London stations may not have firefighters living within a mile.

I appreciate the prospect of distributing binaries for Windows and Mac, but it comes with an additional installation burden. The reason for this is not just technical, as I understand it; versions of the core BSDDB code ship under the Sleepycat license, which requires that projects using it must be published source. This could be problematic if we want Spambayes to be fully PSF-licensed. If someone were to take Spambayes' source and fund their 'addictions' by creating a commercial closed-source spam filter product, the PSF license allows for this but not if the code relies on BSDDB. I'm not in favor of people making money from Spambayes unless it's me, but the PSF license does allow for it. It seems to me that either all or nothing should apply, or perhaps I have misunderstood this situation. This concern has been with me since Plabs announced their integration of BSDDB into Python; it will make it very easy, especially on Windows, for someone to write code using anydbm and ship it under a commercial license without realizing they are breaking the Sleepycat license. They may never have heard of Sleepycat Software or even BSDDB; to them, the bsdbsmbd.pyd file that tells them they need to ship is just another part of Python like socketpyd or selectpyd.

Specifically, the use of sizeof with pointers, which returns the size of types, and not the number of elements in an array. The correct usage is `sizeof var`, not `sizeofvar`. However, if you are intentionally changing the type of a variable using a cast, then you will get the size of that new type. I hope this clarifies any confusion."

       "body": "You need to understand how declarations work in C. You have specified testbuff as an array of pointers to characters, meaning you have allocated an array big enough to store pointers on most machines (bytes per pointer, which indeed would give you 'john on fri nov' as output). The issue seems to be with the return value of sizes by sizeof using pointers. Include the following in your code: int main void char int len size_t sizeOfTestBuff { cout << len << " " << n << " " << return the output from this is, but it should be returning a different value. It appears that using a pointer has multiplied the value of the original size of the testbuff buffer by the size of the pointer (char pointers have a size of bytes as shown when output is 'bytes'). The confusion arises because when sizeof outputs the value for something like char testbuff, the macro seems to be multiplying the sizes of entities passed to it by considering the first entity as the pointer denoted by the asterisk itself and then taking this value of the pointer and multiplying it with the size of the buffer testbuff. This produces an output of 'rather strange behaviour'. The original message was on Tuesday November, stating that the developer libraries or M software has a problem because strlen does not work because the author was trying to get at the allocated size of a buffer, not the actual size of the buffer. You're right, I was looking at the safeStrncpy code and it looks like the author did use strlen. sizeof will return the size of the data type passed to it, so if you declared mystr as char, it will return the value that the original author wanted. However, this will not work if your strings are dynamically allocated or passed to you as a pointer. These macros will not function in such cases."

      "body": "Subject: University Education and Social Change - Report Insights\n\nThe growth of university education in Britain has led to a significant shift in societal tolerance, particularly towards homosexuality. According to the British Social Attitudes Survey, half of people now believe that homosexuality is always or mostly wrong, down from three quarters years ago. This trend is also reflected in attitudes towards ethnic minorities, with a greater percentage of people saying they are not at all racially prejudiced compared to previous years.\n\nProfessor Geoffrey Evans, a politics professor at Oxford University, has focused on what has caused Britain to become more open-minded. In a report published today, the study from the National Centre for Social Research suggests that young people are much more tolerant than their elders. The key factor in transforming bigotry appears to be higher education.\n\nGraduates are twice as accepting of homosexuals as those with no GCSEs and one-third less racist. This transformation occurs regardless of the student's social class, and with 50% of young people now attending university, it is a powerful social effect.\n\nProfessor Evans states that 'Mr Blair's famous mantra "Education, Education, Education" seems far less consequential now than when first announced.' He adds that while higher education can provide a bulwark against the undermining of liberal democracy through intolerance, it may also be simply because university students have increased contact with alternative points of view.\n\nThe study also found that the educated are more tolerant towards civil rights for unattractive white supremacists. People scored higher the longer they had spent at school and university, with nearly two-thirds of graduates saying that white supremacists should have the right to give television interviews or stand in elections.\n\nProfessor Evans also looked at whether the young may grow out of their idealism but found the opposite to be true. Thirtysomethings were more than twice as likely to say there was nothing wrong with homosexuality as they were when they were in their early twenties.\n\nOther findings include: - More than half the country wants cannabis to be legalised compared with a third seven years ago.\n- Two times as many Labour voters as conservatives have tried cannabis.\n- Living in London and having a degree also increase the chances of trying cannabis.\n- Contrary to other trends, hard drug opinions have grown stronger over the past seven years, with more people believing that heroin dealers should always be prosecuted.\n\nAlison Park, co-director of the study, said, 'People are making quite a clear distinction between what they think of as right and wrong on other matters.' The survey indicates that almost half those questioned think that most of the social security budget goes on unemployment benefits in fact they account for %. Union membership has fallen by a fifth in the past years with just under a third of workers in a union, and half those questioned oppose secondary school selection."

I have been running the unseen window with a black background on a root window that is all black with no borders or other decorations, but made sticky so the appearance is just like the folders with unseen messages and their counts are written into the root window because it is sticky; this small display follows me around, and I can see when new mail needs processing.

The error 'no such element in array' during execution of the if flisttotalcountmhprofileunseensequence flaginner spool iconspool labelup else flaginner down icondown labeldown procedure flagmsgseen line fixed in cvs: This seems to be a problem with a specific script. I suggest reviewing this script and ensuring it's properly updated.\n\n2. The missing 'msgmarkunseen' function: You mentioned using this function to mark messages as unread. If it no longer exists, you might need to find an alternative way to perform this action. Perhaps exploring the sequences menu for a similar function would be helpful.\n\n3. Window layout preferences: You prefer your Exmh windows in specific column arrangements. To achieve this, you could consider using 'pack side top' instead of 'pack side left'. However, since each window has a different width, this might not look optimal. An alternative approach could be to order sequences by preference and have those that don't fit fall off the bottom.\n\n4. Unnecessary background coloring: You prefer a consistent color scheme for your Exmh windows. To accomplish this, I can ensure that there is no unusual background coloring in the requested window.\n\n5. Sequences based on multiple folders: A preference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder would be beneficial. This would help keep the list size manageable while remaining productive.\n\n6. Sequences for unique messages: You often use sequences to remember particular messages in a folder. It would be useful if sequences not previously defined could be created and used for these purposes.\n\n7. Expanding the sequences menu: The sequences menu on the bar with new flist search only contains unseen and urgent. Including all defined sequences within this menu would improve usability.\n\n8. Colorization concerns: You mentioned some issues with colorization, particularly when entering a sequence name in the pick box and a message number or range. I will look into this issue to resolve any syntax errors.\n\n9. Current message highlighting: You requested making the current message stand out more by changing its background color slightly.

They might have a cat that fits your criteria: healthy, resembles a Persian breed, friendly with children. The establishment is unlikely to charge you an arm and a leg; instead, they may ask for a donation. Your daughter may not be too concerned about the cat's origin as long as it's well taken care of later on. I recommend taking the cat to a vet for a checkup and ensuring it receives necessary vaccinations. It might also be wise to have the cat spayed or neutered while you're there, but note that most sanctuaries will already have this done. Some cats in these facilities may have been mistreated previously, so they might not interact well with children or could be shy. Therefore, it would be beneficial for your daughter to meet the cat you've selected to gauge their compatibility.

Interestingly, I have another individual with similar setups and a couple of cats as well. One day, the cats sat on top of the tank, waiting for the fish to swim by, preparing their paws for attack. However, trouble arose as the fish were also interested in feeding, and they were significantly faster than the cats. Consequently, the cats couldn't actually hurt them, as they only eat very small rodents in the wild. Now, the cats are wary of approaching the fish tank. Personally, I have been bitten by these creatures many times, but I've only drawn blood once. I wanted to express my gratitude for all those who replied to my unexpected email about our feline friends. I never knew so many people shared this fascination! As for your obsession with cats that hunt, it's not mine. Evolution, anyone? It's true that I don't like mice and rats in the house, and we haven't had any since we got our current cat. You may find it intriguing that while cats sometimes bring birds to your bed, they are usually the wrong kind. In fact, it's mostly mice they bring, but they will eventually stop bringing their kills back to the house once they realize you're not interested and are never going to learn to hunt. Essentially, they are trying to teach you hunting. The kittens first bring back kills, then later they bring back live but injured prey for the kittens to practice on.

I personally dislike rodents, especially when they invade our home, and fortunately, we haven't encountered such an issue since getting our current cat.\n\nIt's true that cats sometimes present birds in the bed, but let me clarify that it's usually not the type of bird we appreciate. To be more precise, it's mostly mice they bring, and after a few summers, they should stop doing so once they realize you're not interested and are never going to learn to hunt.\n\nYou're correct in stating that cats use this behavior to teach their kittens hunting skills.

   "body": "Subject: Inquiry about Spanish and Irish Language Schools in America\n\nHi there,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I've been pondering a question regarding the status of Spanish as a foreign language in America, and I was wondering if you could clarify my understanding.\n\nFrom what I've learned, Spanish indeed continues to be considered a foreign language in America, which seems more useful than French for many. However, I've also heard concerns about political indoctrination in Irish language schools, particularly when I was a teenager. They had us marching, saluting flags, singing national anthems, and college anthems. While I understand that adult learners might be treated with more dignity, I can't help but wonder if minor outbursts of English in emotional circumstances would still be met with reprimands.\n\nIf I decide to attend a class, I'm there primarily to learn. Any incorporation of anthems or politics will be taken as additional insights, but only with my critical thinking cap fully engaged, just like when I engage with mass media. However, I would prefer to avoid any overt political indoctrination.\n\nRegarding the Irish course I took in Dublin, they did indeed perform the national anthem, which is fine. Each day at school in America, I started with the Pledge of Allegiance, including the 'under God' part, which annoyed my father greatly. However, such indoctrination didn't stick at the age of five, and I doubt it will have an effect now.\n\nOn a separate note, I was thinking about open-source software like OpenOffice and Gaeilge (Irish). It would be beneficial if there were an Irish spell dictionary converted for OpenOffice, similar to what Abiword already has for Irish spell checking and some interface strings translated. This was discussed around a couple of months ago, but it seems to have drifted to a horribly small percentage.\n\nI've noticed a significant opportunity for a fully Irish computing environment in the free software world. However, I don't see much action from official Irish organizations. The reason Mandrake and some others have Irish support is due to individuals like Donnacha Kevin, who are believers. As George Bernard Shaw once said, 'The happiness of credulity is a cheap, dangerous quality.'\n\nIf you're part of any Irish Linux users group or know where I could unsubscribe from such information lists, I'd appreciate the help.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"

It's interesting to note that the Basque government has funded the translation of Mandrake to Basque, making it possible for users to install and use the system in their preferred language.\n\nI believe that the organization responsible for promoting Irish within the Irish government could learn a lot from this approach. The Basque government previously paid Microsoft for translating Windows, but they found it excessively expensive and the translations would often be outdated by the time they were released. Now, they are promoting free software while also supporting their language - a win-win situation.\n\nBest wishes,\nArkaitz Irish Linux Users Group"

     "body": "Dear Recipient,\n\nKevin Lyda's websites make me question my opposition to capitalism. This month, it seems debatable whether to prepend or append disclaimer statements. In reality, they are the legal world's equivalent of mandatory email fashion accessories rather than being legally binding. They should be used sparingly as blanket pre-appending of disclaimers dilutes any legal effectiveness they have. Disclaimers are not binding and have little meaning other than in certain situations where professional reasons may require indicating the standing of an email, such as 'this is not legal advice'. However, this means that disclaimers need to be context-specific. There is precedence under UK law that blanket disclaimers have no standing, and it's the context of the situation that determines the legal effects of an email. For example, see the Norwich Union case.\n\nHere are my top tips to help superiors who've fallen for disclaimers:\n1. Server side appends break email standards unless always done correctly, which is nearly impossible as then the server has to understand every possible type of client encoding and it does break certain types of encryption that depend on the body being untouched.\n2. It contravenes MIME to pre-append non-mimetyped text. Most mailers will work around this and display the mail correctly, but some might not - for example, the message might not be displayed or the disclaimer might not be displayed in the correct place.\n3. The correct place for disclaimers is on the client side. This allows the user to select appropriate disclaimers for appropriate context or no disclaimer at all.\n4. Blanket appended disclaimers are of dubious legal effectiveness and can often be completely inappropriate. They should be written by an actual lawyer.\n5. Many big multinational corporations do not append disclaimers, such as Compaq (deceased) Motorola (I think), Microsoft (I think).\n\nUseful links are provided at the bottom of this page.\n\nIf you can't get a reason to prevail and you have to agree to implementing server side disclaimers, you can still resort to having stationary printed with disclaimers. Also, we might have to play a disclaimer before or after all our telephone calls - wait, that would cause a problem for faxes wouldn't it?\n\nRegards,\nPaul J."

While we have moved the screening off the ILUG list, we are keeping it close enough for those who were initially interested to attend. This is not a complete offlist event as requested, but rather a semi-private showing that aligns with our organization's status as a non-profit private entity. \n\nWe are authorized for the UC Santa Cruz screening of Revolution OS on June and appreciate IEEE's good faith effort to correct the initial mistake. However, I would kindly ask members of SVLUG to hold off on attending this screening until we can secure a high-quality print of the film at a camera in San Jose. \n\nI am currently trying to get Revolution OS booked into a theater in the Bay Area and would prefer that SVLUG's members have an opportunity to see a nice print of the film if my distributor is unable to accommodate this request. If my distributor is unable to book the film, I promise to work with SVLUG to quickly set up a screening for its members as soon as possible. \n\nI understand that some members of SLUG may be unhappy about the initial request for an unauthorized screening of Revolution OS. There are several reasons behind my decision, none of which involve wanting to be difficult or anti-open source. One SLUG member questioned why a movie about the open source movement would not be available for open viewings, while another saw similarities with Bill Gates' open letter to hobbyists. However, it is essential to clarify that making Revolution OS myself does not automatically mean I am an open-source advocate or that the film itself should be considered as such. \n\nI made Revolution OS because I found the open source movement and free software compelling subjects worth exploring and documenting. I came to admire many aspects of the open source movement, but I do not believe in making my intellectual property freely available without my consent. The explicit copyright notice at the end of the films credits makes this intention clear. \n\nI understand that viewing a personal copy of Revolution OS for private use is considered fair use. However, publicly advertising a screening on a university campus and charging admission would constitute an infringement of my intellectual property rights. I hope to release the DVD version of Revolution OS as soon as possible but cannot afford to take on any more debt related to the film. \n\nI truly appreciate the enthusiasm for Revolution OS within the open source community, and I am grateful that people want to see it. I understand the desire to support the open source movement by sharing content freely, but I hope you will bear with me as I seek out legal opportunities for all interested persons to view Revolution OS. \n\nI apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding.

If 'i' and 'a' are hardlinked and both are copied, then the copies will also be hardlinked. This is true of all cpio and tar and any other decent usable archival tool in his opinion. He notes that cpio p (at least the gnu cpio version) will only read-write copy the actual data bytes once. If an intermediate archive cpio o file cpio i file is used, the actual data bytes are copied into the archive file under each name, but gnu cpio is smart about this in passthrough mode (p), copying the data just once.

However, a significant portion of the data has two directory entries (a hard link). I'm proposing a method where we can navigate to the destination directory, create an archive of the source directory with 'tar c sourcedir', compress it into a pipe using 'cf tar cf' and then extract it at the destination with 'tar xf tar cf'. This should maintain permissions, links, and ownerships (if done as root).\n\nThis method has not been tested yet, but it should work. However, please note that the data will be read and written twice by the source tar and read twice by the sink tar, although only written once as the sink realizes the second copy is a hard link to the first.\n\nThe reason archives always contain data for each name of a hard link is probably due to several reasons, such as providing redundancy to deal with bad media. While this might add to the time and CPU resources consumed, it doesn't impact storage in this case since the full archive isn't saved.\n\nIf you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to reach out.

Or do you mean that somehow floyd is now the new foo, and that bar now points to floyd?\n\nI apologize for failing to mention earlier that floyd might not use the inode but may do so, and that was my point. Having these mythical symlinks point to the device inode is not straightforward, just like the 'unrm' thing - it might be possible, but hard links and soft links are the best implementations that have survived on Unix systems thus far. Windows shortcuts are somewhat peculiar; they're more of an application-level thing. Mac aliases seem to blend the concept of Unix symlinks (linking by filename) with the idea of device inode.\n\nI don't know the specifics about Mac internals, but I was told it attempts the former first and then the latter.

I believe there is a symbolic link from '/mnt/public/mnt/public/downloads/linux_wastecpuseti@home' to '@home/cwynnesetit'. The '/mnt/pubseti' directory resides on an external RAID volume, while '@home/cwynnesetit' is on the internal drive. Since I don't need to navigate around the file system (GAF), it seems that this would be considered across different devices if you are wondering. However, probably not.\n\nThe reason for the duplicate 'mnt/public' directory is because I restored from a tape backup and didn't know it keeps the directory structure. Now that I know, here are my thoughts on how to fix this quickly and easily: initially moving the structure to '/tmp', then copying it back seems like a solution.

       "body": "Regarding your discussion on soft links and hard links, here's my understanding based on your email: \n\nSoft links were invented because directories couldn't be hard linked at the time of their introduction, although hard linking of directories was possible in earlier systems. This restriction was due to potential issues with infinite loops in the kernel, which is generally a bad scenario. However, many Unix systems I have used don't allow hard links for directories or restrict them to root users. \n\nOver time, some systems limited soft links to the same device but eventually gave up on this consistency with hard links. Now, soft links behave similarly to hard links, but they break upon deletion or moving and may consume slightly more disk space. \n\nA better approach might be to implement global unique filesystem identifiers for every created filesystem to minimize clashes. Additionally, the target information for a soft link could be represented as a filesystem identifier (fsid) and inode pair, allowing the operating system to determine if the linked item is now on a different mount point or has been moved. \n\nThis approach seems to be what's done in some systems, but it's unclear whether aliases are implemented differently. Let's call these 'supersoftlinks'. For example: ln ss foo bar, then ls i foo shows foo, and moving foo to floyd (foo mv floyd) results in bar no longer pointing to foo (bar no longer points to footrue), but removing floyd preserves it. The filesystem would need to maintain a table of links going the other direction for this system to work effectively. \n\nThis approach doesn't handle network file systems (NFS) or filesystems with dynamic inodes, such as FAT and Reiser. I believe."

With soft links, you would need an additional namespace for deleting items according to rules, and then manually count the references to decide what stays and what goes. On the other hand, hard links allow for automatic deletion by simply unlinking. Although Niall's explanation seems accurate, I will still endeavor to find a more compelling reason for using hard links. It appears that the primary difference between symbolic links (soft links) and hard links is that multiple hard links to the same file are identical, whereas a soft link points to a real file, and its deletion results in a broken symbolic link.

This will break one or two other packages due to entries in etcldsoconf which belongs to glibc.

Boot the system in a non-graphical mode as x and kerberos are now broken. Your etcldsoconfrpmsave will contain clues about what else might be broken.\n5. To fix x and kerberos, you need to reinstall their libraries by copying etcldsoconfrpmsave back to etcldsoconf (using rpm -ivh replacepkgs if available). Other libs listed in your etcldsoconf like qt, mysql, and sane may behave oddly; reinstalling the libs for these packages might fix their issues.\n\nI would also suggest avoiding bogging down the system with X (graphical user interface) unless it's necessary for the server to serve as a user machine. In such cases, you could limit its use to staff or admins only. If possible, I recommend using webmin for day-to-day maintenance and providing the local admins with a restricted set of tasks they can perform.\n\nFinally, you mentioned migrating a hard disk from an Intel box to an AMD box. Since RHL installed on the i686 machine will not boot on an Athlon/Duron box, the solution is to replace the kernel and glibc with versions compatible with the AMD processor.

However, optimizations at the compiler level can introduce complications such as compiler errors, which are difficult to trace and require a deep understanding of what is happening to either report bugs or fix them yourself.

This feature allows me to connect to external hosts using SSH via a proxy, similar to Squid and most other good proxies. However, these proxies typically don't allow connections to any destination port other than the default, so the sshd needs to be listening on the PuTTY's proxy port. At the moment, the proxy support in PuTTY is a bit unstable, as the raw connects are not working consistently with certain revisions of iOS due to their different prompts and success strings. I haven't delved deeply into the SOCKS proxy support yet, but it's available if you need to SSH through a proxy. For this purpose, you can use netcat. Please note that it will take a few more weeks for the PuTTY's proxy functionality to become stable and it currently does not send keepalives, so if you step away from your session, expect it to be terminated by the proxy. Netcat sends keepalives, which prevent this. Here's a quick example of how to use netcat with PuTTY's proxy:

       mkfifo infifo

    `ftp: 127.0.0.1`

    3. Create a new file in /etc/tcpwrappers.d/ with a name that corresponds to your FTP service, for example, ftpd. Allow access only from the IP of your user (if known) or use a wildcard for dynamic IPs:

      "body": "John Gay is currently investigating issues with the PGCC site, as it appears to have gone over a year without an update. In addition, he's looking into GCC itself, now that the series has been released. It's possible that GCC may be better or at least as good as when the PGCC patches were written. GCC has made significant strides since the time when it split from the main branch due to slow progress, with Linux distributions such as EGCS partially derived from the PGCC work. The world rejoiced when harmony was restored with GCC. \n\nThe Pentium processors have better instruction sets than the ones they still support, but GCC only takes advantage of the cmov instruction introduced with the Pentium Pro. Code compiled with this option will fail on older Pentium and earlier processors. The Pentium also introduced pipelining, and properly generated code can run faster due to this feature (known as instruction scheduling - rearranging instructions for optimal parallel superscalar pipeline usage). GCC does a fair job at instruction scheduling, but the PentiumPro option does a better job and fine-tunes for more processors like Athlon and AthlonXP. They're working on replacing the compiler's instruction scheduling with a new mechanism that should do an even better job, but this is still in development. \n\nRegarding exotic instruction sets, GCC will use SSE or similar instructions if you use the mfmathsse option and may see some speed benefit, but there's a chance of incompatibilities. Current versions of GCC won't use MMX or instructions, although user code can explicitly generate these instructions with C code. The kernel sometimes uses these instruction sets for superfast memory block copies or RAID math, but not much else is known about the improvements they bring. \n\nGCC has a much improved version of SSE and is a viable replacement for FPU code, supporting only single precision floats while being able to handle doubles. MMX and SSE share registers with the FPU, which limits them somewhat, but have their own large dedicated register file. So far, AMD CPUs are said to be the only ones equipped with it. \n\nFor unsubscription information for Paul Irish's Linux Users list, please refer to the provided instructions."

       "body": "Subject: LFS Compilation Optimization Clarification\n\nDear John,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I've been doing some research on the optimization process when compiling software for Pentium, as per your recent email about ILUG and LFS.\n\nIt appears that by default, most programs and libraries are compiled with optimizing level GCC options (-Og and -march=native) to suit a specific CPU on Intel platforms. This means that the software is compiled for processors by default, unless you wish to run it on other machines as well.\n\nTo change the default compiler options for higher optimization levels or architecture-specific code generation, you can export the following flags:\n\nexport CC=gcc -O3\nexport CXXFLAGS=-march=native -O3\n\nThe 'march' option will compile the binaries with specific instructions for the CPU you have specified. However, this means that the binary can't be copied to a lower-class CPU and executed.\n\nRegarding your question about optimizing GCC or Glibc, it seems that Glibc might be the most suitable candidate for optimization as it provides libraries used by even the most basic programs to access system calls in the kernel. I'm still awaiting information from the GCC mailing list regarding optimizing and patching GCC for performance improvement.\n\nSo far, the only suggestion has been to try using ICC (Intel's C Compiler), which is known to work with the kernel. However, user apps and libraries might need rewriting to compile and I'm not prepared to go to this length for Qt and KDE at this time.\n\nThere are also gains to be made with object prelinking, but there are also risks involved. So, I guess I'll just have to wait and see.\n\nRegarding your base build, I understand that you're still waiting for some DRI patches for your card. Once you're ready, I believe it will be several days before you can start building X. In the meantime, I wish you all the best with your project.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"

       "body": "I have two separate projects for this weekend. The first one is about mod_gzip, an Apache module aimed at speeding up serving static and dynamic mimetype web content. The second project is configuring the Compaq Smart Array for Linux on a server running Red Hat Linux with all updates, and a client also on a Compaq laptop, both stock Red Hat. Here's a step-by-step guide:

       For mod_gzip, navigate to the root directory, then execute the following commands:
       wget <url_to_download_mod_gzip>
       gunzip mod_gzip.gz
       apxs -ci mod_gzipc

       After that, add the following lines to your Apache configs. Please note that my Apache config is split among many files:
       LoadModule gzipmodule usrlibapachemod_gzip.so
       AddModule mod_gzipc
       ModGzipOn yes
       ModGzipMinimumFilesize [desired_minimum_filesize]
       ModGzipMaximumFilesize [desired_maximum_filesize]
       ModGzipItemInclude file .html
       ModGzipItemInclude file .htm
       ModGzipItemInclude file .txt
       ModGzipItemInclude file .php
       ModGzipItemInclude file .pl
       ModGzipItemInclude mime text
       ModGzipItemInclude mime mod
       ModGzipItemInclude handler perlscript
       ModGzipItemInclude handler serverstatus
       ModGzipItemInclude handler serverinfo
       ModGzipItemExclude file .css
       ModGzipItemExclude file .js
       ModGzipItemExclude mime image
       ModGzipDechunk yes
       ModGzipMin ModGzipTempDir tmp
       ModGzipKeepWorkFiles no
       LogFormat h f "%{mod_gzip}n %{mod_gzip_inputsizen} %{mod_gzip_outputsizen} %{mod_gzip_compressionrationpct} mod_gziplogs customlog logs/compression.log"
       ModGzipLogs Enable
       Finally, run 'service apache2 reload' and check the logs to see if it's working. If you have serverinfo available, you should see that mod_gzip is loaded and a compressed line and a non-compressed line might look like 'roo sslglossaryhtml ok roo'.

       For Compaq Smart Array configuration on Linux, I found a solution by searching 'compaq smart array configuration linux'. One of the hits led me to download an RPM, install it, and run the server according to instructions. Note that if you're running the browser locally, omit the 'r' in cpqacuxe. I couldn't get Galeon to work, but Mozilla did. You may need to enable popups in Galeon's configuration if you want to try it. Once logged in as administrator, point Mozilla at login and change your password, then go back to the main page and click the little drive array graphic towards the bottom to configure your array as desired. Stop the server by typing 'cpqacuxe stop' when you're done. I partitioned the drive, built the filesystems, and so on. The drive was now accessible.
       Hope this helps some folks!

After a while playing with GCC, he managed to get it to spit out a bunch of warnings when compiling the kernel. There's a lot of stuff that still needs cleaning up for things like function abuse and the like, as it doesn't even compile due to broken assembly constraints and other such problems. It isn't recommended for this purpose yet, but as more and more architectures start using it as their standard compiler, we should clean up some of this stuff. Neil also tipped me off about a new warning called 'wunusedmacros'. Turns out, far too much cruft from what I looked at was correct in most cases, and yes, there were macros being defined but unused. Cleaning them up, however, creates a maintenance nightmare for anyone with patches in those areas already, particularly hurting people like myself who have huge patches touching large parts of the tree. The recent struct initializers patch, for instance, made large parts of my tree reject with more to come.

If you're discussing the firewall itself, ipfilter might come out on top since it has a longer track record, but in essence, they are quite similar.

I was referring to the new pf code in OpenBSD and ipfilter, not the old firewalling codes as they have been rewritten recently due to licensing concerns. I believe there may have been some confusion about this.\n\nSecondly, you mentioned that you have a few boxes running netfilter/iptables with reasonable uptimes, but one has crashed twice after day-long uptimes. It seems that the issue is not necessarily with netfilter/iptables, as there are many factors that can contribute to system instability. I would recommend monitoring these boxes and using heartbeat to ensure high availability.\n\nWhen considering a firewall solution, it's important to keep in mind that familiarity with the operating system plays a significant role. If the company has extensive knowledge of Linux but little experience with FreeBSD, I would suggest going with a Linux box, as someone within the company will be able to troubleshoot issues related to netfilter/iptables more effectively.\n\nLastly, I wanted to address your comment about nitpicking arguments among Unix variants. While it's true that we can debate which firewall and Unix code is better, it's essential to keep in mind that both FreeBSD (ipfw) and Linux (netfilter/iptables) have their strengths and weaknesses.

To begin with, the FreeBSD's ipfw is not encumbered in the same way as the old OBSd firewalling was. Yes, you are correct that it has been rolled out into the stable branch of code, which is a significant release still under development to some extent. However, I have a few boxes with reasonable uptimes running Netfilter/iptables; one box crashed twice after day-long uptimes, but this doesn't seem to be an issue specific to Netfilter. \n\nAs for FreeBSD's ipfw, I don't have extensive experience with it, but the closest I've come is looking at ipfilter for IRIX. It had a problem that it wasn't maintained anymore. Although the Englishy syntax might be appealing, I don't think the iptables command syntax presents much of an obstacle. With the advent of Netfilter/iptables, there isn't much difference between them from a technical perspective apart from ipfw being in use for a longer period. \n\nHaving used ipchains quite heavily around two years ago, I can assure you that the learning curve for reading ipchains rules and ipfw rules is quite different. However, this shouldn't be a decisive factor when choosing one firewall product over another, especially if the learning curve for the operating system is the same. \n\nGetting off-topic now, but since I've been doing quite a lot of work with ipfw over the last week, I decided to join the bandwagon.

I wanted to clarify some points regarding the firewall software in FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD.\n\nIt appears that you were discussing the differences between ipfw (FreeBSD), ipfilter (NetBSD), and pf (OpenBSD). The firewalling code on all the BSDs was initially related, but FreeBSD's ipfw is not encumbered in the same way as the old NetBSD's firewall due to different licensing. ipfw was specifically written for FreeBSD under a BSD license by Luigi Rizzo, one of the FreeBSD whizzes.\n\nNetBSD packaged ipfilter which has been around for quite some time and offers a slightly different feature set to ipfw. However, last year, the author of ipfilter, Darren Reed, changed the license on development branches of ipfilter to prohibit redistribution. This change upset Theo de Raadt, among others, and led to OpenBSD creating their own firewall called pf under a full BSD license.\n\nThe official releases of ipfilter are still unencumbered as always. Recently, ipfilter has been rolled out into the stable branch of the code, which is essentially a major release that's still a work in progress. It offers some nice syntactic sugar and is faster for certain types of complex rulesets, but it might not be ready for production yet.\n\nI have no personal experience with ipfw, but I've come closest to looking at ipfilter for IRIX. However, it had an issue as it was not maintained anymore. While the Englishy syntax is nice, I don't think the iptables command syntax is a significant obstacle.

This is a stable branch of the code, but I must admit, it's still in progress and not quite ready for production yet, having been released last Wednesday. It does add some attractive syntactic sugar and is reportedly much faster for certain complex rule sets. However, I would question its readiness for production due to its instability.\n\nIt's important to note that this new release has maintained backwards compatibility with ipfw, which is a significant advantage. My mentioning of it being rolled out into the stable version was simply an illustration of the fact that ipfw is not ipfilter and that there are no license issues there.

     "body": "Regarding Niall O Broin's email, here is a rephrased version:

     Niall is installing warm standby disks on several machines. These disks will be the same size, or sometimes larger than the main disk. Each night, he will synchronize the partitions on the main disk to the standby disk. This way, in case of a disaster, the first course of action before using tapes would be to use the standby disk. Instead of implementing Linux MD RAID on the disks, Niall suggests using individual hard disks because RAID does not provide protection against human error.

     In terms of a more distributed solution for error prevention, he proposes that each machine could send its kernel to other machines over the network. This way, if the drives are open and switched between cables, you can start using a floppy before you begin. If the drives are in drawers, this method might slow down operations by a few seconds. Alternatively, he suggests using netboot. To do this, set the boot sequence to prioritize the hard disk followed by the network. Do not activate any partition on the standby disk.

     Niall also recommends looking at the Etherboot package, which includes a Pascal-like language for creating boot menus. You can write a simple command that says 'boot' or whatever you prefer. There is an example code available. The downside of using this method is that you will need a bootp and tftp server somewhere.

    "body": "I considered performing Lilo b devhdb mnt, but I believe 'b' is equivalent to the 'boot' keyword in liloconf. This won't work automatically, as boot devhda tells Lilo what sectors to manipulate and it determines the disk location from the 'r'. If you proceed this way, you might end up with a boot loader on the backup disk that contains the physical location of the bootmap file on the main disk. This may not necessarily match the backup disk's location. I couldn't think of a suitable solution with Lilo in this scenario. My home machine uses rsync to a backup disk every night, but I'll need Rh install CDs to sort out Lilo if I have to do a disk swap. Grub should be able to handle this easily since it doesn't record sector numbers like Lilo does.

       "body": "It is rumored here that Niall O' Broin is installing warm standby disks on several boxes. These disks will be the same size or larger than the main disk, and every night he will rsync the partitions on the main disk to the standby disk. In case of a disaster, the first action would be to check the standby disk before the tapes. We considered using Linux md raid on the disks but decided against it as raid does not provide protection against human errors such as slips of the finger. If there is a slip of the finger, we can mount the relevant partition and retrieve the damaged file. In case of a disk crash, we plan to replace the main disk with the standby disk and the workstation will be back up as soon as possible so that we can deal with replacing the disk without the pressure of a broken box on our back. However, I am stuck as to how to install Lilo on the backup disk. Let's say the master disk is devhda and the backup disk is devhdb. The liloconf currently looks like this: boot devhda, changerules reset, readonly, menuscheme, etc. If I had booted from a CD and wanted to reinstall Lilo on this disk, I would do something like mount mnt, mount mntboot, lilo r mnt, which is ok because I am installing Lilo on devhda and want it to boot from devhda. However, in the case of the standby disk, I will have to do something different as I want to install onto devhdb in such a way that the disk will boot when it becomes devhda after a disaster like the one I had this morning: shutting the stable door was on the todo list but the horse decided to run away early. The machine already has its spare disk, just hadn't yet been used. I thought perhaps I should just do lilo b devhdb r mnt but I think that 'b' is analogous to the boot keyword in liloconf or will this just work automatically? ie boot devhda tells Lilo what numbers to poke where and it figures out where the disk is from the 'r' from the hard disk upgrade mini. Thanks to Rick Masters for helping with this. We are assuming that Lilo is installed on the hard disks master boot record mbr, which seems to be the most common configuration. You want to install Lilo on what's presently the second hard disk but will become the first hard disk. Edit the file newdisketcliloconf as diskdevhdb and tell Lilo to treat the second disk as if it were the first disk. Boot devhdb and install Lilo on the second hard disk. Map a new disk boot map in the location of the map file, install the newdiskbootbootb file to copy to the hard disks boot sector. Provide a lilo prompt, set the boot default system after a certain number of seconds (the value is in tenths of seconds), provide the location of the newdiskbootvmlinuz (the actual name may include a version number for example label linux). Location of root partition on the new hard disk should be modified appropriately. Note that you must use the name of the future location once the old disk has been removed.

Unfortunately, there seems to be little documentation available, and Google isn't much help in this regard. From my understanding, there are multiple ways to input scripts such as Chinese, and the choice depends on personal preference, equipment (like your keyboard), and the application in question. There seem to be two main methods: one unique to the tool itself, often referred to as Yudit, or using what's called an XIM (X Input Method). I'm making some educated guesses here based on my interpretation of what I've read and observed. XIMs generally work as a complex compose frontend, where you build up your character as a series of composes of the root or fundamental strokes, radicals I believe they are called, and then commit the composite character to the application. Yes, keyboarding these scripts is quite slow, and a good typist can only do a few characters per minute. Using a QWERTY keyboard for this purpose is believed to be quite painful. Some XIMs compose in place, others do it on a special line, and some seem to do it in a special window or the root. Also, some XIMs apparently support a US-ASCII input mode as well, not a general Latin alphabet input mode which seems to require another TLA called KBD, and which apparently doesn't work when an XIM is also being used, implying you have to switch back and forth between US-ASCII input mode (what English speakers would call normal keyboarding) and the other input (like Chinese). I'm not sure, but I have the impression that the switch is often a toggle. Please note that this information might be incorrect or misleading. If you're using the so-called Limbo release, you may be using a locale by default already.

If I don't want to get rid of the MBR as it will destroy the OS on that drive, how can I remove LILO without using the above fdisk procedure? Performing fdisk MBR would restore a DOS MBR, but leave the partitions alone. Deleting all Linux partitions with fdisk will actually leave LILO in the MBR.\n\nCurrently, when I execute fdisk MBR on my Linux drive (which is not related to the MBR drive), the following message appears: 'mbr is on a separate drive not related to the Linux drive'.

These systems work by creating a character as a series of composites or combinations of root or fundamental strokes, which are often called radicals. Typing these scripts is slow, and even a fast typist can only manage a few characters per minute. \n\nOne example given is the Pinyin input method where you phonetically spell out each character using the Pinyin romanization rules (e.g., zhong guo for China is entered by typing zhong and then being presented with a list of possible matches, with the most common first in a numbered list). Other methods are more keystroke-efficient but lose the phonetic simplicity of Pinyin. \n\nSome XIMs compose characters in place, while others do it on a special line or in a special window. Some also support a US ASCII input mode, although this seems to require another TLA (Three Letter Acronym) called kbd and does not work when an XIM is also being used, implying you have to switch back and forth between US ASCII input and the other input (e.g., Chinese IM). The toggle for switching between the two is often 'Ctrl Space'."

Every user in the network utilizes SSH and an SSH agent on login, which works fine for navigating around the network and accessing some of our external boxes - until today. Suddenly, when Alfred tries to SSH anywhere, he's prompted for a password. He claims nothing has been changed, but I believe him.

The issue seems to be linked to Alfred as it occurs when he logs in on different workstations and all other users, including Alfio, don't experience any problems. Our system uses only DSA keys. I've included an extract from a ssh debug log for both users below:

My laptop is the only Dell I've had thus far that a quick clean install of Linux could be done on without issues. However, recently, it seems that some cheaper pieces of hardware such as Ethernet cards, modems, sound cards, and graphics are incompatible or unsupported. I don't know how long I've spent banging my head against the wall with these troublesome Dell machines! The IT admin of the company I'm currently in has ordered these budget machines, but they seem to be getting the components cheaper as well. If you decide to buy from Dell, be cautious about what you order, as the default config cheapo machines are always a headache. Here's my experience with our new Dell machines: I tried installing Red Hat Linux, and it didn't seem to want to recognize the onboard Intel graphics card, which doesn't have dedicated memory and takes it from the onboard RAM. I was wondering if anyone has gotten these machines working with Linux, specifically regarding this graphics card issue.\n\nWhen I installed a PCI Diamond Stealth VRAM card, xconfigurator autodetected it without any issues along with my Sun monitor. However, whenever it tries to test the configuration, it fails, and the screen is left with a blue background, and all of the text is blue.

This is a risk you take when purchasing hardware systems for Linux without verifying chipset support first. Over the years, Dell has caused less trouble in this area compared to many competitors. As for the phrase 'if c gives you enough rope to hang yourself then c give you enough rick moen to bind and gag your neighborhood rig...', I believe it's a metaphorical expression that doesn't directly relate to our discussion about Linux compatibility with Dell systems.

Since it's a large continent, knowing where you're going might help suggest sources.

Also, will it be difficult to bring it back to the shop once I'm home in Dublin and find it doesn't work? Any monitor should just work, they all have VGA connectors and any half-decent brand will be recognized by Xfree setup programs in modern distributions. However, if you have the budget for insurance in case the monitor dies.\n\nYou mentioned your monitor got caught in a bathroom upstairs flood and started clicking rapidly and smoking before it was unplugged.

Currently, at work, we simply buy Sun's latest system, jumpstart it, and it's up and running. This is convenient for administering a large group of workstations as we can use boot net install. However, this method doesn't allow for checking Dell's website every time a machine is needed, which would consume a significant amount of time, especially in dealing with drivers and compiling new versions of X. This isn't an issue if you have one machine at home, but it becomes impossible when working with a large bunch of systems. It's unfortunate that a Linux distro doesn't often work out-of-the-box with Dell systems. To mitigate this, you can check the support section on Dell's website for downloadable drivers that match the system configuration. If there aren't any Linux drivers available, you can usually find out the chipset of each device and search Google for discussions about them. Keep in mind that you'll often be told the make model of each device rather than the chipset, so further investigation is necessary.

Additionally, there are tools like Afterstep and WindowMaker available for Solaris which might interest you. Currently, my personal preference is Enlightenment, and it also has Solaris packages available for download.\n\nThe installation procedure involves a net install. You can install SPARC Linux using this technique as well. The image takes some time to load, but once that's done, the installation proceeds normally. I believe you're asking if 'normal fashion' means that you still have to do interactive customizations or if it's like Solaris Jumpstart where everything can be specified on the install server. To clarify, yes, there are some interactive customizations required, but the process is straightforward.\n\nUsing the boot net install method, you should wake up to a fully installed and patched desktop the next morning. There may be minor issues with serial console drivers for workstation installs, but I don't anticipate this causing major problems.

However, I expect significant improvements since then. What I am really interested in is running Gnome on one of the Sun Ray thin terminals, out of curiosity. Does 'normal fashion' imply that interactive customizations are still required, or is it like Solaris Jumpstart where everything can be specified on the install server?\n\nI understand that an automated installation with a few script changes might be possible, and I wouldn't be surprised if Debian already offers this. If you pass extra parameters on the boot command, they are picked up by Silo boot disk Linux, which would boot straight through without prompting for selection.\n\nCould you please automate the installation process by transferring the correct config file? This should not present a major problem as the 'ok' prompt is almost at the hardware level and doesn't depend on the OS. Once the machine is installed, I should be able to log in over the network.\n\nThe challenge lies between when Linux boots and when the console tty drivers are started - this can be a black hole without error messages or login prompts. Another problem arises when Linux drops into the prompt on shutdown instead of powering off or rebooting, making it impossible to reboot the box without physically accessing the power switch.\n\nIf the console is active, it may drop into the prompt if it is devnull, preventing console messages but ensuring proper shutdown.

That is, there is more logic executed including NIC (Network Interface Card) logic when going 'down to the metal' than when using 'lo' (loopback address).

My final year project surfaces an intriguing question: is a loop or a recursive call actually superior to a 'goto', or is the 'goto' used as a kind of common enemy in programming syntax? While I would love to answer an unqualified yes, I must admit that coding in a style that relies heavily on 'gotos' does not significantly improve code when transitioning to 'gosubs' or function calls. The same argument was made about modular coding in the past, where manuals advised writing modules that would fit on a single sheet of computer paper. Many coders then divided their code into arbitrary chunks. However, the article 'goto considered harmful' emphasizes the importance of understanding the point of execution and variable values at that point, which is easier when the code uses assignment, if-statements, and functions but not when it uses 'gotos'. Despite being one of Dijkstra's 'braindamaged children', who learned Basic at an early age, I no longer use 'goto' or any of its offspring like 'break', 'continue', and fudged function calls with variable manipulation. Although my code may be longer than it would be if I had used 'goto' at critical points, my current approach has benefits when another person modifies or debugs the code in three months' time, as they don't have to deal with the complications of 'gotos'.

However, there's always a balance with inlining - speed versus memory bloat, which might not always be a trade-off, especially when swap starts getting involved. This is something that tends to frustrate programmers who can spend significant amounts of time inlining code and relying on optimization tools for performance improvements. It's important to note that the best performance gains can usually be achieved by fixing the algorithm itself. Optimizing function calls that are made infrequently often makes no sense, as it can lead to illegible code and nonsensical algorithms. Inlining is beneficial for functions that are frequently called and small, such as string manipulation routines, but these comprise a minor part of most applications. A common example I encounter is the optimization of database function calls. Many database accesses involve numerous abstraction layers and millions of instruction cycles. Trying to save a few instruction cycles would result in cost savings of perhaps seconds over hours, but a simple hashmap cache of common data, without any compiler or inline optimizations, can turn those same hours into minutes.

It seems that TMDA is not typically an SMTP proxy, but I'll explain what an SMTP proxy is for clarity: An SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) proxy is a server or software that acts as an intermediary for other servers sending or receiving emails via the SMTP protocol. Normally, an SMTP server stores and forwards email messages. \n\nConfiguring your email server to use the SPEWS blacklist and a good open relay is a method to discourage spammers. A SPEWS (Spam Experts) blacklist lists entire ISP netblocks if the ISP consistently fails to act on abuse reports over several months. However, they are quick to delist once appropriate action is taken. In the absence of global and effective anti-spam regulations, this method is currently the most feasible approach to achieving a spam-free internet. An open relay protects against relays as you may already know. \n\nLastly, I wanted to remind you not to send any email to or Irish Linux users for unsubscription information. \n\nRegards,\nKevin Lyda"

This system is designed to combat spam by identifying if an email sender's domain is participating in spam activities. Unfortunately, spammers often use real return addresses that aren't their own. If everyone implemented TMDA, these unlucky individuals would receive millions of additional TMDA confirmation messages along with the hundreds of thousands of undeliverable messages they currently get. The concept is similar to TMDA SMTP proxy but not as extreme as TMDANet DNSBL (Distributed Checksum Algorithm and Block List). It also includes various other checks.

I use cdrecord and the SCSI over IDE kernel modules. Last weekend, I updated the kernel and installed the new one without any problems. This morning, when I tried to burn a CD-ROM, the system locked hard. Rebooting allowed cdburning to work fine.\n\nThe problem is reproducible on my system. The command I was using was cdrecord v1.4a with the 'blankfast data' option. The blanking appears to go okay, but when it tries to write data, it locks up the entire system. It cannot be pinged from outside and a hard reset is required to get back in. When it does reboot, I cannot see anything useful in any logfiles (var/log/messages, var/log/kern.log, var/log/sys.log).\n\nCdrecord scanbus works fine and reports the two pseudo-SCSI devices: my CDR drive and my CDRW. The same lock occurs even if there is no blanking.\n\nI tried upgrading to the latest kernel patches, but it gives the same error. I also downloaded and compiled the source for cdrecord and installed it instead of the Debian package, but the problem persisted.\n\nI wonder if maybe there was some compile option the packager had used which might cause the problem and still the problem persists. Any idea why this might be happening?\n\nIs it likely to be an application or kernel problem? The severity of the crash would make me suspect it is a kernel problem, but I am not very knowledgeable on these things.\n\nShould I post a description of this to the kernel mailing list if this is an appropriate course of action?

If you're looking to purchase a retail boxed set of SUSE, it might be through mail order.

There's also an FTP edition for SUSE (not a CD image), but this requires you to mirror the FTP directory tree and then figure out how to install it, say, over NFS. \n4.

For example, Perl is under the Perl Artistic License, Apache is under the Apache License, and numerous BSD utilities are under the BSD License. Additionally, many applications included in distributions such as Xv Acrobat Reader, Pine, Pico, Netscape Communicator, and others are proprietary and not open source.\n\nHowever, the GPL does provide certain rights to those who receive a lawful copy of covered binary code. Specifically, it allows them to insist on one of certain forms of access to the matching source code. This does not grant any rights if no one has provided a lawful copy.\n\nIn relation to SUSE, they are in compliance with the GPL's source code access provisions concerning GPLed code included in their distribution. No one has the right to alter license terms for someone else's copyrighted property.\n\nRegarding your question about obtaining a Linux distribution that is GPLed and burning a copy, it should be noted that duplicating and redistributing entire boxed sets of SUSE (or any other distribution) may constitute copyright infringement. Only evaluation and live CD editions can be duplicated and redistributed under certain conditions.\n\nIf you wish to obtain a SUSE boxed set for installation, you should buy one directly from the vendor.

However, you've proposed the name 'Dolmen Linux,' and creating a distribution could certainly be an intriguing project.\n\nOne of the first hurdles that such a suggestion would encounter is the choice of packaging system. Some might prefer a FreeBSD-style ports system, others a Debian-style system, and still others an RPM-style packaging. Nevertheless, other Linux User Groups (LUGs) have managed to do interesting things, like creating Blackbox, so the creation of a distro could be... well, quite entertaining.\n\nI'm only laughing on the outside; if you could see inside, you might find me weeping, too.

To clarify, SUSE Linux is indeed a Linux distribution that contains various separate codebases, some under the GNU GPL while others are not. Commercial entities, such as SUSE, offer trial, limited, or crippled editions without any problem. However, it seems you were under the impression that SUSE only sells support and customization, rather than the core product itself. \n\nIt appears that what confused you was SUSE's proprietary extensions that they are not prepared to allow people to use under the GPL or even a FreeBSD-style license. I see your concern about this going against the spirit of the GPL. \n\nRegarding your misconception that paying for SUSE gives you the right to receive the source code for free, it does not. You only need to pay for the media to legally obtain a copy of the binary version, but you don't own the source code. You may request the source code under the terms of the GPL, but it's subject to agreement between the parties. \n\nIf you have no interest in purchasing SUSE boxed sets or its support services and only need the operating system and GNU apps, your friend can lend you his copy without copyright violation. However, you cannot make a duplicate of his CDs, as that would be illegal. \n\nLastly, if you wish to create your own Linux distribution using SUSE's components while adhering to their licensing terms, it is technically possible but may require considerable effort. Alternatively, you can consider trying a different Linux distribution that better suits your needs. \n\nBest Regards,\n[Your Name]"

I understand there may have been some confusion regarding the GNU GPL and the right to obtain covered software for free. To clarify, the GPL does not provide this right. What I was under the impression is that one needs to pay only for the media and not for the code itself.\n\nI offered a bottle of wine, maybe a pint or two, and a chat in exchange for a copy of the software. I believe this falls within the agreement between the parties as the latter is subjective.\n\nThe GPL does allow you to charge for the binaries, but it's important to note that if you do so, you must provide the source code to anyone who asks. This could potentially create a market for people willing to pay for the convenience of getting a binary version.\n\nHowever, the GPL also poses a challenge to any business plan that solely resells GPL software. You can charge for it if you wish, but you must provide some value for that money to avoid going out of business quickly. Providing convenience, friendly installers, vendor-supplied updates, having what lots of other people have, and the warm fuzzy feeling of getting something from a real company are potential ways to do this.\n\nI understand that there will be segments of the market willing to pay various amounts for GPL software, while others may not. Fortunately, the GPL allows for both scenarios, but the source code will always be free or minimally costly later on.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"

      "body": "Dear Nick Murtagh and Kenn Humborg, \n\nRegarding our recent discussion on select statements, it appears that your points revolve around the use of 'break' as part of the syntax rather than a control flow modifier. Although it is understood at an assembly level that break can turn into jump instructions, it should not be used in programming unless explicitly necessary. \n\nWhile you are correct that the break statement is not mandatory and the control flow will continue to the next case if omitted, it is generally advisable not to use things like 'goto' and 'break' to alter the flow of control in your program. This rule serves as a useful guideline, making it easier for other programmers to follow how control moves through a function when the basic control blocks do all the work.\n\nFor example, replacing a break in a while loop with a modified while expression demonstrates this, as you only need to look in one place to see when you'll run off the end of the loop rather than hunt through the entire loop. However, the provided example was not particularly effective due to adding an extra test for 'done' and setting it to 'true' within the loop, which is essentially the same as using a break.\n\nIn essence, leaving out break statements disrupts the assumption that flow goes in zero or one case blocks and exits from the bottom. My suggestion is to only omit breaks in specific situations, and generally include them at the end of each case to ensure clarity for future programmers.\n\nLater, Kenn, for unsubscription information, please visit our website."

I understand that you have previously understood the concept of limited, crippled editions and how they work with commercial entities such as SUSE. I agree that it seems counterintuitive for there to be a problem with this for SUSE, but let me clarify some points.\n\nFirstly, while it is true that SUSE makes money from selling boxed sets, they are also glad to make some versions available for almost unrestricted distribution. However, their motivation for doing so is speculation on my part, as I can't speak for their intentions. What I do know for certain is that they have granted permissions that apply to the SUSE-produced components such as Yast, the distribution installer program, and possibly other utilities.\n\nThe point of confusion was your belief that SUSE had proprietary extensions that it wasn't prepared to allow people to use under the GPL or even under a FreeBSD style license. This is not correct, as copyright law does not permit somebody else's work to be placed under a new license without their permission.\n\nTo clarify, you cannot take SUSE Linux AG's work and redistribute it under what you claim to be a BSD license or the GPL or anything at all other than what the copyright owner has specified because you simply lack the right to do so. This is a common misconception about using GPL software with proprietary offerings, but it is not accurate.\n\nIf you require support from SUSE, that would be a different issue and one for which you would be willing to pay. I hope this helps clarify some of the licensing questions you had.\n\nBest regards,\nLive Faust Die Jungrick Moen"

I found out that your boot filesystem and the bootvmlinuxgz file must be a gzipped vmlinux file, not a vmlinuz one. This might not be apparent when you've been struggling with a problem for a few days. Furthermore, when you create a filesystem named 'boot', it gets wiped by the Red Hat etcfstab, so when you boot from a rescue CD, it doesn't mount as 'boot' and doesn't inform you of this. This can easily lead to confusion, especially if you think you are working on mntsysimageboot but nothing changes. Anyway, I have managed to get the Red Hat kernel booting, but the kernel is not loading root as it keeps mounting curiously. When I go into the boot prompt and use setparams, I can tell it to mount as root, but then it uses the prom copy of the kernel which doesn't know about the disk and wants to fsck it up. The rdev on the vmlinux file before gzipping does not work; I assume you cannot run rdev on the gzipped version. I am looking for other ideas on how to tell a kernel where its root filesystem is.

Nothing else seems to work for setting parameters, but I think the only way is by using a 'setparams' line. However, when I ran 'setparams' and then 'bfd bootvmlinuxgz', it boots the old kernel, presumably from the prompt. It seems that if something goes wrong, no error message is displayed, it just defaults to the original kernel. By the way, 'bfd' stands for 'boot from disk'.

This practice, if indeed it is true, seems to mirror the behavior from the past that split Unix into a mess, leading to the issues it faced before Linux emerged.\n\n In my humble opinion, this type of conduct is reprehensible due to its potential to lock users into an operating system. In the past, vendors wrote their own peculiar installers and configuration tools to achieve this. They added functionality unavailable on other systems to differentiate themselves from the competition. This includes proprietary elements such as Motif on non-free OSes, incompatible filesystems, etc.\n\n While these practices may have been beneficial when sharing code was not commonplace, they now harm the user experience.

However, given the variety of options available such as Mandrake, Yellowdog, Red Hat, Debian, and others, which already cover most everyday requirements, and with many specific situations being addressed by these distributions, I can see why you might consider it.\n\nHowever, creating a new Linux distribution would require more than just adding 'frilly pink bits' and 'crunchy chocolate flavored pieces.' It would involve crafting the distro to offer significantly more than existing alternatives. As for your typical requirements involving better support and easier maintenance, these aspects would require a company to be behind such an initiative.\n\nYou mentioned that it could take weeks or even two months to create a new distribution using Debian as a base, adding specific packages, making configuration changes, and labeling it untested on most hardware variations. However, I would like to remind you that this is just a starting point and the actual development and testing phase could be much longer.\n\nIf you are interested in sharing more information or discussion about creating an Irish Linux distribution for users, please let me know.\n\nRegards,"

When a customer reboots their computer, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) may issue new IP addresses due to a mechanism known as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). This protocol allows the ISP to automatically assign and manage IP addresses for its customers. \n\nIt seems that in your case, the disruption in internet access might have been caused by an expired lease of your previous IP address. The new IP address was assigned after you rebooted your computer, explaining why it worked fine afterwards. \n\nAs for whether this process can be detected and handled automatically, some cable companies do offer DHCP client daemons like dhcpcd that can handle such tasks. However, not all ISPs may do this, so it's always a good idea to have a DHCP client installed on your system. \n\nFor further information and unsubscription details for the Irish Linux Users list, you can refer to the following command: root s bindhcpcd d n y t h.

       "body": "Actually, soft links were invented because hard linking of directories was not possible at that time. As far as I know, this was before my time. All Unix systems I've used didn't allow hardlinks to directories or if they did, they were restricted to root due to the potential for infinite loops in the kernel, which is a bad place for such loops. A better approach would be to have global unique filesystem identifiers (FSIDs) for every file system created, reducing the chance of clashes to almost zero. This could be achieved by implementing the target info for soft links as an FSID-inode pair, allowing the operating system to determine if the linked item is now on a different mount point or has been moved. I believe this is what's done in HFS, but I'm not sure about aliases and their implementation. Let's call these 'super soft links'. For example, using 'ln -s' followed by a name creates a super soft link. If we create 'foo bar' and then move 'foo' to 'floyd', the original 'bar' no longer points to 'foo'. Instead, it now points to 'floyd'. The file system would need to maintain a table of links going in the other direction so that when the 'move' command unlinks 'foo' in the first example, it can mark that 'bar' is now disconnected. This would also be true for the second example and is especially important since 'bar' points to 'floyd'. If no table is consulted, this mechanism fails to handle NFS mounted file systems or filesystems that have dynamic inodes (such as FAT32 and ReiserFS)."

     "body": "Dear John Gay, \n\nI have been considering optimizing packages for my Pentium one and was advised that I should look into glibc. This led me to ponder about gcc itself. I asked another list and got several responses. Most people suggested not thinking much about it, but a few did suggest gcc. One even directed me to Linux from Scratch. \n\nI am curious to understand what exactly you mean by optimizing gcc. On one hand, optimizing how gcc is compiled will only make it generate the same code slightly faster. However, since gcc is a memory hog, it would be more beneficial to buy more RAM or improve file system cache hits rather than worrying about making gcc's heap stay out of swap. \n\nThe Pentium introduced pipelining features which gcc itself is not very good at taking advantage of according to the pgcc site. The pgcc patches are supposed to make gcc generate tighter code, but there are concerns about compiler bugs and the site does not seem to have been updated in a year or more. As the series is out now, it might be better than when the pgcc patches were written. \n\nThe Pentium also improved its FPU logic and introduced pipelining. However, the first generations of Pentiums had faulty FPU logic programmed into them (the Pentium bug). Subsequent ones were fine. These added instructions are faster than equivalent ones. The difference between the Pentium MMX and the Pentium should yield a significant speed boost if optimized correctly. There are faster floating point instructions and pipelining that need optimizing for, but I am not sure if gcc can optimize properly for the pipelining at least the pgcc group found significant improvements to add to gcc to gain speed improvements of up to 50%. None of this will have any effect on I/O bound processes, but GUIs are mostly CPU bound. \n\nI am also investigating object prelinking optimizations which should provide even better performance for Qt and KDE. If I had another Pentium III for my box, I could take advantage of those SSE instructions to optimize as well. Kevin \n\nRegards, Irish Linux Users Group"

     "body": "Dear Ciaran Johnston,\n\nThank you for your email and for all the feedback. I understand that you are considering the Seagate internal drive, but are concerned about its price. I have found an OnStream IDE tape drive through Martin's link, which seems to offer more storage at a slightly slower speed for half the price compared to the Seagate drive. However, you asked if there is any overriding reason to choose the more expensive drive other than speed.\n\nThe Advanced Digital Recording (ADR) tape format is an interesting option that I hadn't come across before. It appears that OnStream spun off from Philips Electronics and has a tight control over the format, although other companies like Verbatim do produce compatible media under license. If you are reasonably serious about backup, it's important to plan for a rotational backup scheme and retirement of tapes as they become worn. This requires at least a couple of dozen tapes for the first few years, making cost and availability of media a significant factor.\n\nAnother factor to consider is that tapeheads wear out and need to be replaced more frequently, especially for helical scan systems like ADR. However, it seems that ADR does not use a helical scan method, which could make it cheaper in the long run due to less tape wear.\n\nOne less tangible consideration is that if your OnStream ADR drive fails, you would need another OnStream ADR drive to restore your backup sets. This means you are somewhat locked into the system, as I couldn't find any other ADR drives. However, OnStream might have priced the drives to attract people into the system and recoup costs on media sales later.\n\nI have found the following prices for Verbatim ADR tapes: Euros per GB; Euros per four-pack of ADR tapes; Euros per ADR cleaning tape. You don't get much lower pricing than Verbatim without going to noname capacities, which are usually quoted on the basis of a nominal compression ratio.\n\nThe OnStream datasheet mentions a linear serpentine recording technology, which is good like DLT, SDLT, and LTO rather than a helical scan method typified by DDS, DAT, and AIT, which put heavy wear on tapes and heads. I'm not sure what software other than NovaStor TapeCopy and Yosemite Technology's TapeWare will support OnStream's drives, but my recollection is that Bareos (Bacula) will do it.\n\nOn balance, I would still go with a drive using either or media mainly because once you've survived one oddball less-standard tape format, you're not in a hurry to repeat the experience. However, ADR does seem well-designed and might be a good bet after all, as they say in the gaming industry: 'You pays your money and you takes your chances.'\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]"

I miss the 'repeat' command in prefix. It echoes prefixpdraigps, but I know how to do it with loops. Here is a solution using seq and sed. In my opinion, it's a rather dim solution as it might fail if the string contains certain characters and probably has other ways to fail too. A bash loop would certainly be faster, but you know how to do it with loops: prefixseq $number sequence sstring. I consider this solution a bit more robust with the parameters being the number of times to repeat and the repeat string itself, separated by quotes (e.g., '3 "hello"'). However, loops in bash are somewhat slow. While we're on the topic of silly bash questions, is there a way of getting the exit status of a command without using 'something like command'? For example, can I do something like result somemagicwayofquotingcommand instead of command result?

When the client connects and sleeps for seconds, additional processes (client, z) are created. However, when the client exits, the expected secondary thread does not finish, accumulating memory consumption by about every time a client connects.\n\nThis appears to be an issue, possibly related to PThreads, a coding error or a Linux bug. It is important to clarify if the number of processes accumulates or if it's just the number of threads that is increasing. If the latter, then this behavior seems normal since you don't create the thread until the accept returns, implying a thread manager in the program. Afterwards, there will always be processes for the thread manager.\n\nFurthermore, the stack for additional threads is allocated from the heap. It's possible that glibc does not reclaim the space as efficiently as malloc/free do, especially since memory allocation for threads may be required again soonish.\n\nBest regards,\nPaul Jakmakey"

     "body": "Hello John McCormac, \n\nLast week, during indexing for whoisireland.com, I observed an inconsistency between and banbadomainregistryie regarding the SOA record, with a discrepancy of a few days. The other nameservers seemed to provide current SOA data at that time, but the affected secondaries might have been using AXFR for propagation, causing this error. I'm unsure about 's role in relation to the ie zone; as far as I recall, it may be involved in zone distribution. However, it is not part of the regular resolution process.\n\nOn Friday, a serial number was encountered that none of the IE nameservers shared. Unfortunately, I don't have a record of this serial number.\n\nThis inconsistency raises concerns about IEDR's decision to outsource the technical administration of ie to a company that apparently does not even administer its own DNS. It's an interesting story, reminiscent of the time when IE was unavailable for hours in July and you were the only one who noticed.\n\nShortly after my note on Friday, the affected servers stopped responding to DNS requests, causing IE to have two dead nameservers, four stuck, and three functioning correctly. Marvellous!\n\nBest Regards,\n James"

      "body": "Dear James Raftery, \n\nI'm not certain about your role regarding the IE zone, but it doesn't seem to be involved in the regular resolution process. It might have a role in zone distribution as I recall, and I remember having an issue on Friday with a serial that none of the IE nameservers shared unfortunately, without a record of that incident from indexing. It appears that cno appears to be iedr's cno nameserver for its cnodomains (iedr.com and others). \n\nThis situation indeed raises questions about IEDR's decision to outsource the technical administration of IE to a company that apparently doesn't even manage its own DNS. It's an interesting story, almost as good as the time when IE disappeared for hours in July and you were the only one who noticed. Messages on the iedrforum list at the time don't support your assertion, but remember, you were there. Those who said it didn't happen did not witness the fadeout in progress; it came back after the server was rebooted properly. However improbable it seemed at the time, the nameservers came back up after a power outage without the IE zone file as a result. There was nothing in the file that secondaries picked up at the time I thought that the file was on NFS, but if it regenerated after reboot and the NFS input wasn't there, it would have generated a blank zonefile. That makes some sense now, but it has an alarming relevance.\n\nAs an aside, the nameservers stopped responding to DNS requests on Friday and had two dead nameservers, four stuck, and three working correctly. A week ago, we had a similar issue. The nameservers themselves had connectivity problems, and it was ongoing even after the initial SOA problems. I am thinking of writing a simple IE secondary state monitor for inclusion on whoisireland.com as these guys seem to be technologically incapable of running their own DNS. Whatever selection process IEDR used should be investigated by the relevant government department, especially as the company supposedly providing technical administration to IEDR didn't actually spot this loss of synch. The IEDR contract with the company should be reviewed in light of this event. This kind of week-long loss of sync shouldn't happen with a national domain like Ireland, more like e-jit central.\n\nRegards,\nJohn McCormac"

    "body": "Hello Brian, I understand your concern regarding the unwanted IP access on your PC. It seems you have been unable to resolve the issue despite using Ad-Aware spyware removal software and contacting the relevant company. Here are a few suggestions that might help:

1. Malwarebytes: This is another popular anti-malware software that could potentially detect and remove the unwanted program causing the issue.
2. Manual Malware Detection: Since the offending program does not seem to be in Ad-Aware's database, you may want to try manual malware detection. This involves running a system scan with various tools like Sysinternals Suite or Process Explorer from Microsoft, and Malwarebytes Anti-Explorer.
3. Contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP): If the issue persists, it might be beneficial to contact your ISP for assistance as they may have more insights into the IP address in question and potential solutions.
4. Network Segmentation: As a preventive measure, consider network segmentation. This involves separating your PC from other devices on your network using a router with VLAN capabilities or a dedicated network for your PC. This can help prevent any malware from spreading across your network.
5. Reinstall your Operating System: If all else fails, you may want to consider reinstalling your operating system. This will ensure that your PC starts fresh and any hidden malware is removed. Be sure to back up important data beforehand.

Hopefully, one of these suggestions helps you resolve the issue. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."

My question is why this is necessary as most languages parse submitted form data into either variables or an array hash which can be named freely.\n\nThe issue you've mentioned regarding linking the regions select action with the sites select multiple through JavaScript seems to be due to the fact that JavaScript can't refer to the select multiple by name because of the brackets. Instead, it has to be referred to by its location in the DOM. As for why the variable name needs to end with a suffix when PHP parses the submitted form data, I'm afraid I don't have a clear answer as my understanding of PHP might not be comprehensive enough.\n\nRegarding your mention of the webdev mailing list, it appears to be referring to a restaurant that is advertised as being just three minutes from a cinema, yet no one seems to ever go there.

In PHP, when processing submitted form data, the data usually comes out as either variables or an associative array (hash) which can be named as required. If the query string contains 'varname=first&varname=second', PHP will create a variable called 'varname' with the value 'second'. However, if the query string is 'varname[]=first&varname[]=second', PHP will create an array with indexes, starting from 0. There are other ways to get data from the request and I may resort to those methods if it proves simpler for the script that generates the form.

The manual page suggests that etcRazor/razoragent.conf will be loaded first, but it doesn't mention that RazorAdmin will then create a Razor directory in the user's home directory if it doesn't exist. This could potentially lead to some minor confusion if the user is trying to set the discovery and other defaults for a default (e.g., etcRazor install).\n\nThe workaround is as follows: explicitly specify the path to RazorHome on the command line, e.g., \n\n    - razoradmin home etcRazor\n    - createRazorAdmin home etcRazor discover\nThis should help in setting the defaults for etcRazor install.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"

HP backs off DMCA threat by Cnet Newscom staff Aug PT
Hewlett-Packard Thursday abandoned legal threats it made against security analysts who publicized flaws in the company's software. In a statement released late Thursday, HP said it would not use the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to pursue a loosely organized team of researchers who demonstrated a bug in the company's Unix operating system.
The following is the company's statement:
'HP is committed to protecting our customers' security environments. We have verified that there is a security vulnerability with Unix. The details of which were brought to our attention July [the problem has now been isolated and HP has been preparing a fix which will be available within the next hours]. We won't comment on the specifics of our discussions with snosoft, however we take our customers' security requirements very seriously and have a strong track record following industry-standard security practices. Where and how the DMCA should be applied is a matter of great controversy. The reported letter to snosoft was not consistent or indicative of HP's policy. We can say emphatically that HP will not use the DMCA to stifle research or impede the flow of information that would benefit our customers and improve their system security.'

These revocations serve as a system's punishment for reporters who report legitimate bulk mail, making their future reports automatically considered suspect. The recent changes to the system have drastically decreased the likelihood of filtering mailing list posts. If you notice false positives on the EFF newsletter again, please keep me informed. It seems strange that most Razor errors were related to free speech issues and intellectual property; it makes me wonder if someone is deliberately trying to poison EFF messages. I am also actively involved in the development of SpamAssassin rules; spam filtering has been a hot topic at EFF for quite some time, and is even more relevant now that I'm actually using it. Your system is considered to be the cleanest method, but with any system, people at EFF are concerned about free speech issues and potential censorship.

He also inquires whether a single revoke decreases the rating of everyone who nominated the message. \n5. If a new user reports a message that has already been reported, does their trust level immediately go up? The same question is asked for the case of revoking a message. \n6. It is also mentioned that mincf in razoragentsconf should be set to default server recommended average confidence which at the moment is setting it to 100 should return true for whatever is submitted as long as it was not revoked by a trusted user. \n7.

The issue lies in the fact that there are often gray area messages where some people may vote 'spam' while others might vote 'non-spam'. \n\nUnder this proposed system, anyone who ever classifies a gray mail message as non-spam could potentially end up with a low trust score. This is problematic because once you have a low trust score, your own submissions may not be used to flag spam. This could lead to confusion since you have marked the exact message in question as spam and expect it to be considered as such.\n\nFrom what I understand, the level of trust appears to depend on the proportion of 'report' vs 'revoke'. If everyone but one person classifies a mail as spam, that individual will see their trust drop significantly. Conversely, if you are in the majority, your trust increases, and if you are against the majority, your trust decreases. If people's votes neither align with the majority nor against it, their trust remains unchanged.\n\nThis suggests that gray mail submissions may not have a significant impact on trust scores, either positively or negatively, making them somewhat neutral in this context."

It appears that it may be vulnerable to gaming, and the initial setup cost for a gaming agent could potentially be low, making it easy to operate without being easily distinguished from real user behavior. The question is how much extra work this would entail, both upfront and ongoing. However, it's important to note that not all spammers will take the time to game the system. \n\nAnother concern is that a small number of gamers could potentially undermine the entire system. It's unclear yet if our current universe is one where the trust system is sensitive to liars or misclassifiers of gray mail, but we might end up with a less than effective system despite the high cost of achieving perfect accuracy. \n\nYou do need a certain level of accuracy in the system though, as a filter that doesn't achieve this isn't economically worthwhile. If it only filters out spam, it's a waste of time. The ratio of good to bad mail is crucial here, and this problem becomes more important as the global ratio worsens. \n\nI can't comment on Razor currently as I'm not familiar with it, but I suspect it was chosen because it's relatively simple to implement and thought to work reasonably well if not completely without fault. Time will tell how good it is at adjusting over time to gaming strategies. Currently, SpamAssassin has a nonzero false positive rate and this will always be the case. \n\nAny system will have a nonzero false positive rate, including the 'no filter' filter. Humans make mistakes too sometimes, but as spammer strategies evolve over time, I'm fairly confident that SpamAssassin will be able to adjust and compensate if spammers figure out how to easily pollute the spamnet trust system. \n\nI'm not sure how easy it will be to replace the trust system with something else. Craig might just be theorizing, but I thought I'd offer my two cents. Most of the theorizing is based on little data, but the key premises I'm worrying about are that the trust system is easy to pollute, and it's not personal which makes the assumption that all honest voters agree on what constitutes spam. Something simple and actually implementable that works reasonably well is better than something that works perfectly but will never be implemented because of its cost. The challenge is that everyone defines 'reasonably well' in dramatically different ways. grin \n\nIt seems to have been a long time in coming, apparently it's quite resource intensive judging by Cloudmark's fundraising efforts, and it doesn't currently work. It has great promise though, and I'm hoping that once the wrinkles are worked through, it will add another powerful tool in the war on spam.

To achieve a high trust rating, it is not necessary to block anything; rather, confirming Razor's existing opinion on a large number of spam messages and then submitting them will boost the trust level. However, this process reduces the information in SpamNet by damping. \n\nI suggest two potential solutions to prevent spammers from exploiting the system without hindering legitimate users:\n1. Implement a mechanism that identifies frequent submission/revocation of the same email. If such activity reaches a certain threshold, an alarm would trigger on Razor's server, potentially leading to the user ID being disabled or deleted.\n2. Develop a spamtrap by subscribing to numerous legitimate non-spam mailing lists and spreading the email address across various channels to attract spammers. This approach could result in large quantities of both spam and non-spam emails daily, allowing the system to identify the behavior quickly. \n\nIt is possible to check for the high submission/revocation rate but there may be legitimate reasons for such behavior; I cannot currently think of one, but AOL proxy server might serve as an example from another domain.\n\nSincerely,\nDice - The Leading Online Job Board for High Tech Professionals"

This would result in the email receiving large volumes of both spam and non-spam messages daily.\n\nThe algorithm provided could then be applied to this incoming mail stream, which might raise concerns due to its high frequency.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that such behavior can have legitimate explanations, though I can't think of one at the moment. The AOL proxy server comes to mind from another domain as a possible example.\n\nIf trust is quantified as a percentage and there isn't an upper limit that can't be reached, this could prevent a small number of users from gaining undue advantage. My assumption is that if Razor users can reach this limit or nearly reach it, spammers would find it difficult to cheat by merely building up their trust; they would need a significant number of fake users instead.\n\nFor the sake of fake users, spammers usually don't have access to many sets of network classes. They would need numerous users from the same set of IPs if Razor servers detect people on a Class C network IPs reporting emails daily, which could trigger alarms as something seems amiss.\n\nFor legitimate proxies and similar services, spam should not be reported automatically but manually. There might be a way to have exceptions, for example, IBM networks would have numerous users from the same set of IPs but are unlikely to be spammers, so no alarm would trigger for their network or at least the alarm would be less sensitive.\n\nHowever, AOL could still cause issues, and even then, for a particular phone line, the set of IPs is probably quite small, even smaller than a Class C using network subclassing. Spammers might try to have several connections at different locations, but this increases their cost and therefore may not be very appealing.\n\nRegards,\nJehan\n\nP.S.

Technically, there are no bits in the rights assignment; perhaps a feature can be added to RazorReport so that it checks whether a message is spam before it submits it. If it is spam, do not send the body, signatures etc. Instead, up the rating for that individual. RazorReport only sends the body if the server does not have a copy already, and when it does, simply notes who also thinks that mail is spam.

It seems that the error only appears when you report it on sun aug, but not when you check the spam. To troubleshoot this, here are some steps to follow:\n\n1. Check if the RazorReport v is correctly calling 'chad' on 'mike burger'. If there's an issue, you might need to make necessary adjustments.\n2. Since you mentioned that you've done a 'make install' over the existing installation on sun aug, it would be beneficial to try removing and reinstalling RazorReport v to see if that resolves the issue.\n3. As a precautionary measure, consider upgrading to the latest release of RazorReport v as there have been several bug fixes between the two releases. This might help in resolving your current problem.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you face any further issues. Cheers!\n\nRegards,\nGeek Heaven RazorUsers Mailing List"

Instead of automatically identifying known spam, it now requires you to manually check if a message is known spam before deleting it. This change appears to have occurred since yesterday.

The sender, Chad Norwood, is encountering bizarre behavior where numbers seem to disappear unexpectedly. He suggests trying the 'n' switch, which should print out the list of legitimate mails before RazorCheck and the number of spam messages caught by RazorCheck. If this does not resolve the issue, he has requested that I run the following statement: 'razorcheck n logfilerazorlog mailcaughtspam spamfileno'. If any errors persist, please provide him with the 'spamfileno' and 'razorlog' from this operation. He mentions that since using SpamAssassin, he has had less than usual messages incorrectly tagged as spam, but is careful not to automatically report them. Previously, RazorCheck would indicate which messages were known spam in a batch for deletion. However, since yesterday, this functionality seems to have stopped. He assures that there have been no changes made to his Razor installation or configuration. He is seeking assistance to identify what might have caused this change. Thank you, Mike."

To rectify this, you should only report spam to nomination servers or catalog servers, such as those set by the discovery servers' razor agents. These servers can change and will be automatically discovered by your razor agents, who store server names in razorlst files. \n\nIf you have been unable to report spam from Mutt for the past two days due to a connection refused message, it is unlikely that you are doing anything wrong. However, if you would like to use other reporting servers, I would recommend checking with the 'ragoo' community or similar platforms that help maintain free software and networks.\n\nSincerely,\nChad"

       "body": "Dear Sven Willenberger, \n\nI hope this message finds you well. Regarding your inquiry about issues encountered while optimizing the use of Razor within your system, I'd like to address a few points. \n\n1. The error message 'unable to connect to operation now in progress' typically indicates a network issue rather than an issue with Razor agents. It seems that this error is occurring more frequently than expected between clustered servers, which is causing an elevated failure rate within your enterprise level setup. \n\n2. Currently, there is no adjustable timeout setting for the Razor check to await a response from the server it queries. You may want to look into adjusting the milter timeouts, although this won't help if the Razorcheck script times out first. Unfortunately, the timeout is hardcoded and there are currently no plans to make that an option. However, you can always edit the source code of corepm if necessary. \n\n3. Regarding your suggestions about hosting a catalogue server or a caching server similar to mailabuse.org, I understand your point and see potential in this idea. Currently, the system is designed so that servers can be added and subtracted without clients caring if the Razor client cannot connect to a server. It rediscovers all currently available servers and stores results locally. However, we haven't considered the implications, requirements, or caveats of hosting a catalogue server yet. One potential issue might be polluting the catalogue. We are open to ideas on how to certify a catalogue server if this could address your concerns. \n\n4. In terms of bandwidth considerations, only signatures are actually transferred across the pipes, so the bandwidth requirements should be minimal. \n\n5. As for the potential release of caching catalogue servers for others to use, we are looking into this and see a great potential for a very workable tool. If you can provide any assistance or insights on these issues, it would greatly benefit our project. \n\nBest regards,\nChad"

I understand that you have encountered an error message 'unable to connect to operation now in progress' between clustered servers, which has resulted in a higher failure rate than desired.\n\nYou suspect this is due to a previous timeout from Razor agents holding a process ID associated with an open milter socket. You are seeking ways to adjust the timeout settings for the Razorcheck to await a response from the server it queries and shorten the total time for the socket to live per connect.\n\nI see that you are running this as a Sendmail Milter and have suggested adjusting the militer timeouts, but this may not help if the Razorcheck script times out first. Currently, there is no plan to make that an option. However, I suggest you edit the source code (corepm) where you find a couple possible places where that code might be. Specifically, look for 'select new :select sock' and 'socket selfsock sock selfconnectedto server selfselect select lengthgreeting server greeting return if paramsdiscoveryserver unless selfparsegreetinggreeting selfnextserver or return return selfconnect' as these are related to the timeout settings.\n\nRegarding your question about hosting a Catalogue Server, I understand that this is something you have been considering.

    "body": "In regard to Sven, the initial connect timeout is hardcoded to seconds at present; there are no plans to make it an adjustable option. However, you can always edit the source code of corepm. If you wish to modify the initial connect timeout, please look for and edit the relevant lines in the reads and writes sections of the system. CorePM is designed so that servers can be added or removed without affecting clients. If the Razor client fails to connect to a server, it will automatically rediscover available servers, store the results locally, and continue using the remaining servers. I increased the default discovery period to every hour to accommodate the recent sporadic availability of servers. Though the issue was related to syncing and server upgrades, I have decided to maintain this configuration for a while for safety. If a server is taken out, clients will connect, fail to rediscover automatically, save results, and continue using the other servers. There's no need for you to make any changes; everything should work as intended. We are also looking into releasing caching catalog servers for others to use if you would like to participate in this aspect of caching or cataloging, please let me know."

   "body": "Dear Craig R Hughes, I believe there is a misunderstanding here. A high trust rating isn't necessarily achieved by blocking anything; it's more about confirming or refuting Jack's opinions on a large number of ifcheck spam messages. The algorithm seems to boost trust but diminishes the information in spamnet by damping, which is not entirely accurate. Only certain event reports that revoke for spam are rewarded, and the algorithm for detecting these events is based on various factors.

       "body": "Dear Michael Humphries, Alphacommunet Network Administrator,\n\nThank you for your email and for your patience. I understand that you're facing issues with spam entering your mailboxes and are looking to integrate with Qmail. Here are the steps in simple terms:\n\n1. To stop emails from entering your mailboxes, you can configure SpamAssassin or other anti-spam software on your Qmail server.\n\n2. As for integrating Razor with Qmail, it is primarily used to check incoming emails for spam, not to prevent outgoing emails. However, you might be able to use it for this purpose, but its effectiveness would be limited as the spam in question is likely new and wouldn't have been categorized yet.\n\n3. To address the issue of users sending spam, I recommend focusing on those who are causing trouble directly. You might want to consider implementing a policy or taking other measures to discourage this behavior.\n\n4. If you suspect your server is an open relay, close it as it can be used by spammers to send out large amounts of spam.\n\n5. For the specific issue of integrating Razor with Qmail on RedHat, I'm afraid I don't have a ready-made solution. However, you might find helpful resources in the Qmail community or forums where others have encountered similar issues and found solutions.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any further questions or need more clarification, feel free to ask.\n\nBest regards,\nDaniel Higgins, NetCommunications Inc. System Network Administrator"

    "body": "I am addressing an issue concerning the use of your Qmail server for spam relaying. If untrusted users are utilizing your server in this manner, it is likely that there have been mistakes in configuring Qmail, such as forgetting to create an rcpthosts file or similar issues. To address this problem effectively, I recommend a multi-layered approach. In addition to resolving the configuration issues with Qmail, I would suggest incorporating Razor, QMailScanner, and SpamAssassin into your system. QMailScanner provides the Qmail integration framework on which SpamAssassin performs its work, including invocations of Razorcheck. While this combination will be more resource-intensive than simply denying relaying privileges to everyone except trusted users, it offers a comprehensive solution. To learn how to configure Qmail to allow only trusted users to relay, I recommend starting with the official Qmail documentation and searching for 'Qmail newbies guide to relaying'. Additionally, you may find the RazorUsers mailing list useful for further insights on this matter."

I will look into this further by checking the documentation."

This command will mark the email as verified spam and submit the mail message read from stdin to various spam blocker databases such as Vipul's Razor and the Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse (dcc). If the message contains SpamAssassin markup, it will be stripped out automatically before submission. However, it seems that Patrick Greenwell might have asked the wrong questions leading to the wrong answers."
