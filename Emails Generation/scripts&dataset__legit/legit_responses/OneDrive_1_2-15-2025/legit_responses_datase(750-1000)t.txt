Also, I understand that Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI; however, I would like to confirm if they also confirm the Socal Topock point via EDI. \n\nIf they do confirm via EDI, it would be beneficial to have them collaborate with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. It would also be helpful to know if they will provide us with a window similar to their current practice at the Socal Needles point today in TMS, where they don't confirm this cycle but have a non-grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at AM. \n\nCurrently, the Socal Needles point is set up as a passive point for confirmation. The Socal Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. If they do confirm the Socal Topock point via EDI, Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice Request Form that is posted on the TW web site. \n\nI understand that this change is pursuant to a conversation Steve had with Ladd Lorenz last week.

Your feedback from various demonstrations, surveys, and technology showcases has validated that email is a vital part of your ability to communicate effectively. However, your feedback also indicated that you need your email client to have additional functionality and increased integration with other applications you use.\n\nTo meet the demands of today's fast-paced business networks, we are standardizing our email platform by deploying Microsoft Outlook to all the business units we currently support. For projects such as EBS, EES, and Azurix, project plans are still being finalized and will be communicated separately.\n\nThis conversion from Lotus Notes to Outlook will improve your ability to communicate and provide a more consistent look and feel across the standard Office applications you use on a daily basis. We are excited about this opportunity to provide a more robust, full-function solution for your messaging needs.\n\nTo provide you with additional details about the conversion from Lotus Notes to Outlook, we are including a list of frequently asked questions about this project:\n\n1. How does this project affect me? Your current Lotus Notes email system will be converted to Microsoft Outlook.\n2. What is Microsoft Outlook? Outlook is the messaging client you will use to read your email, update your calendar, and personal address book, record to-do lists, etc.\n3. Why are we switching to Outlook? Outlook integrates more effectively with our new operating system, Windows, and the Microsoft products that currently use with Outlook. We can provide you with a more robust mail platform including instant messaging, ability to send person-to-person immediate popup messages, improved PDA synchronization, conferencing server, web access, fax integration, voice mail integration, and more.\n4. When will the Outlook rollout start, and when will I get it? The pilot will begin in late October with the production rollout beginning in late November. We are finalizing our business unit rollout schedule. Additional information will be provided to all business units as it becomes available. Project updates will be posted on the project section of the IT Central web site at <com>.\nAdditionally, you may send questions to <com>, and a member of the project team will be happy to address these individually."

    }, The article discusses the surge in profits and revenue for El Paso Corporation, a company involved in natural gas production, transportation, and trading. The company has been accused of market manipulation by California state regulators, who argue that the high prices paid by power generators when the gas was delivered to Southern California compared to the lower spot price of gas bought in the Permian Basin is evidence of such practices.

The article highlights a debate over oversight of the industry and questions whether the rising profits are due to robust markets responding to supply and demand signals or to market power and affiliate abuse. The company's CEO has denied any wrongdoing, stating that there are rules in place to protect against affiliate abuse.

The article includes quotes from analysts who discuss El Paso's market capitalization, profits, and growth prospects, as well as criticism from critics who contend that the company set out to exploit volatile market conditions. The article also mentions a sealed document filed by El Paso merchant in response to California's complaint, which allegedly suggests that the company intended to make money by increasing the gas flow in the pipeline and widening the basis spread (the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end of the pipeline and what it could be sold for at the other end).

The article is part of a joint effort with PBS Frontline, which will produce a documentary on California's energy problems later this year., {

It's great to see both Agave Energy and Comanche Gathering looking to bring new gas onto the TWS system. The review of available taps to bring mmbtud into the system sounds promising. \n\nI also appreciate the information regarding the increase in TWS deliverability by mmbtud at Topock, effective December. This will certainly help us maximize revenue for the company. Congratulations to all the field operations personnel who contributed to resolving our contamination issues with PGE on a timely basis, and for building an atmosphere of trust and credibility. \n\nThe market spreads between production basins and the California border have shown significant volatility this week, with contracting prices by Thursday due to weather fears and storage shortages across the US pushing prices up and down. It's impressive that we successfully negotiated the record-setting deals on PGE trading mmbtu for PGE trading mmbtu, and for Sempra mmbtu LFT for December transport options. \n\nRegarding our recent FERC filing, it's good to know that it's currently on the commission's docket for next Tuesday, November [date]. We expect the commission to order a technical conference before the end of the year. \n\nLastly, it's interesting to note that NGPL producers behind Marathon's Indian Basin plant are trying to move additional volume to TW via the recently reactivated NGPL Winkler interconnect. It seems that NGPL is evaluating cost options to add compression, which would also help us sell the point as a firm receipt point and extract more value."

       "body": "It appears that there is a proposal for an EFHB deal with BRT regarding gas from Red Bluff Bitter Lakes, north of South of deliveries off the south end of the WTX lateral. This gas could potentially be sold westward through the Agave nominations under the EFHB rate schedule. Additionally, Agave could nominate a total of 'x' amount from these supply sources into the central pool. It is suggested that this gas doesn't need to flow through Agave's existing east facilities, and it could be done under EFHB if Agave didn't want to commit to incremental firm. However, they would have the obligation to flow. It seems that this option may merit a rate adjustment. Moreover, it could potentially be cheaper than some of the options discussed yesterday or something we might consider in addition to modifications for Red Rock and PNM deals.

It appears that Williams did not disclose the amount of volume response they received during their open season, but they are pleased with the market interest shown in the project which aims to transport gas supply from the Rockies to the Midcontinent region.\n\nThe project is expected to transport up to dthd (unspecified unit) from the Cheyenne Hub to Williams Hugoton Compressor Station on the Central System in Southwest Kansas and its Oklahoma-Hugoton Pipeline. The project would also have access to ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern Pipeline, Northern Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Pipeline of America.\n\nWilliams believes this project will be able to supply a seamless transport at an incremental cost to Oklahoma intrastate markets by way of the Central System. Through the Central System, customers would also be able to access storage including directly owned and third-party storage fields. Williams expects Western Frontier's rates to Hugoton to fall in the cents per dth range, with a fuel rate of less than expected to be in service during November.\n\nThe project will require the construction of nearly 500 miles of pipeline and the addition of horsepower compressors.\n\nBest Regards,"

     "body": "Thank you for sharing the proposed provisions. I've taken note of the suggestions and here are my thoughts on them:

    1. **Provision 1**: As suggested, it's important to clarify the scope of services. However, instead of using a specific percentage or flat fee, we could use a flexible pricing model that adjusts based on the complexity and volume of tasks. This way, we can ensure fair compensation for our work without limiting our ability to adapt to changing project requirements.

    2. **Provision 2**: Regarding the exclusivity clause, while it's understandable that NSS wants this to protect their interests, we prefer not to restrict our services to a single client. We believe that diversifying our client base will allow us to grow and provide better service in the long run.

    3. **Provision 3**: The indemnification clause is necessary for protecting both parties, but we should ensure that it's balanced and fair. It would be best if we could work together on a mutual understanding of what constitutes a breach of duty, negligence, or infringement.

    4. **Provision 4**: The termination clause should include a notice period and a process for resolving any disputes that may arise during the termination. This will help maintain a professional and collaborative relationship throughout the agreement's lifecycle.

    5. **Provision 5**: The confidentiality clause is essential, but we prefer to keep it general rather than listing specific types of information. This approach allows for flexibility in addressing future developments that may not be currently anticipated.

    6. **Provision 6**: Regarding the non-compete clause, while we understand NSS's concerns, it would be challenging for us to commit to this without hindering our ability to grow and adapt to market demands. Instead, we propose a reasonable restriction on soliciting NSS's current clients during the agreement term."

      "body": "The email discusses several developments and updates related to Transportation West (TW). Here are the key points:

1. Two new long-term index-to-index transportation contracts were completed this week: one with Dynegy for calendar year from San Juan to the California border, and another with Calpine under similar terms.

2. Dynegy executed two short-term index-to-index contracts for November: an MMBTUD deal (Monthly Market Based Rate Daily Usage) and another for November-December (both deals are from San Juan to California). Hedges have been established on all the contracts to minimize exposure to market indexes.

3. BP-Amoco purchased two packages of space at max rates on the Ignacio to Blanco route, acquiring MMBTUD for calendar year and another for November with the exception of a small package of Permian to Cal border in November. All available firm transportation flowing west has now been sold out on TW through the end of the year.

4. ExxonMobil presented a proposal to inject a drag reducing agent into several segments along TW's system. This could potentially increase westward volume capacity by enhancing compressor efficiencies and providing increased corrosion protection. However, the final results of the NNG Cunningham test segment are still pending due to contamination issues on the mainline. It is expected that the san juan lateral pipe will be coated sometime before the second quarter.

5. TransColorado is evaluating outsourcing its entire back office operations, including legal, regulatory, accounting, and marketing requirements to a third-party provider. ETS has prepared a draft qualification statement to be submitted by January. TransColorado hopes to complete the transaction by late February.

6. Project McKinley (California border peak shaving) attended the marketing operations meeting in Long Beach this week to discuss the potential of injecting Natural Gas Liquids into TW's system to increase the BTU content of gas going into California. The project involves numerous logistical details, including deciding where to site the injection point, addressing railroad siding issues, NGL storage tanks, and possible contamination of downstream facilities. A follow-up meeting is planned for the end of January.

7. Online TW marketing representatives attended online training as they prepare to roll out capacity deals on the east end of TW's system. The plan is to begin selling by February, offering three to five packages per day of MMBTUD as market demand picks up. They will expand the offerings as needed.

8. The new interconnect with EPFS in Eddy County, NM is behind schedule. Initially committed to have TW's facilities finished by January, EPFS notified TW that there is still quite a bit of work left to do before gas can flow, including securing the row from the BLM for electric pole installation."

I have shared your concerns about the unacceptably low efficiencies with the team, and we will take another look at the lateral as soon as possible to confirm whether or not it's necessary to reapply the DRA. We will also coordinate a conference call to better align our activities. For scheduling purposes, could you please provide an estimated volume for the pigging operation assuming we have to pig between 2 MPH to apply the DRA? Also, regarding the Bloomfield-Gallup segment, I agree that it would be beneficial to pig and reapply the DRA again in April. We will make arrangements with Darryl and Gallup accordingly. Regarding your question about the budget impact from pigging activities this year, I understand that you took a good look at this segment prior to moving into tariff last year, but as we approach the non-tariff months this year, it would be best to review this again to ensure no potential problems exist.

I have reviewed the information you provided, including the pictures of the station. Here are my comments: \n\n- The current free flow rates north on this lateral average around 1 MMCFD.\n- The gas supply is from the Leedy plant and various low pressure gathering interconnects.\n- The gas flows north bypassing the compression unit but utilizing the dehydration unit at ivanhoe. The gas ends up with NNG on the north side of the lateral.\n- The lipscomb lateral is isolated from the TW system at the Canadian River block valve.\n- The units at ivanhoe are idle and were designed for higher pressure delivery to NNG since they have not run in some time. It's probable that we will spend an additional to activate and upgrade the control panels and end devices.\n- To abandon these units, I would recommend either abandoning in place or holding them for future use. My guess is about $50,000 to pull spool pieces and blind flange the units.\n- I am aware that there is some drilling going on in the area, but I don't see a tremendous influx of supply to support the cost to utilize this lateral any differently than its current status."

However, FPL's shares dropped due to disappointment that FPL was not the takeover target. The combined company will serve over 50 million customers and have 120 GW of power generating capacity. FPL supplies electric service to about 10 million customers in Florida, while Entergy delivers electricity to approximately 10 million customers in parts of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\n\nThe deal, a $30 billion merger, includes their combined market value of $125 billion, $65 billion of Entergy debt, and $79 billion of FPL debt. FPL shareholders will own 65% of the new company, and Entergy's board of directors will be comprised of members from both companies.\n\nTo support the deal, FPL and Entergy plan to buy back a total of $10 billion in stock: $8 billion in FPL stock and $2 billion in Entergy stock. Each FPL shareholder will receive one share in the new company for each of its million diluted shares outstanding, while each Entergy shareholder would receive 0.75 shares in the new company for each of their million diluted shares outstanding.\n\nShares of FPL fell more than $10 and Entergy shares fell more than $9 yesterday afternoon. Based on FPL's price on Monday morning, the deal values Entergy at around $68 per share. Many had speculated that FPL was to be bought rather than involved in a merger. The merger agreement includes a $1 billion breakup fee in case either side terminates the deal.\n\nThe merger of FPL and Entergy must be approved by shareholders as well as federal regulators and is expected to close next year. The combined company expects to pay a dividend that is consistent with FPL's current dividend policy based on its current annual dividend of $2.50 per share. Entergy's shareholders would receive $1.87 per share compared with its current dividend of $1.67 per share.\n\nFPL's Broadhead will become the chairman, and Entergy CEO Leonard will become CEO of the new company. The expected annual cost savings and increased revenues for both competitive and regulated businesses may range from $2 billion to $3 billion, with about half the cost savings coming from workforce reductions mainly through attrition, growth, and voluntary retirement."

Jim Crist, a lecturer with IGT, is preparing a daylong seminar customized to our interests and issues. Here's my top list on why GPG staff need to increase our understanding of the electric industry:\n1. First and foremost, gas-fired electric generation is the growth market for gas pipelines. We need to get a sense of why and where generation is being built and who the likely customers are.\n2. We need to understand electric utilities as customers: Who is the customer these days? The generator? Who should we be dealing with within the utility organization? What types of load patterns should we expect from various types of electric players? What types of services do they need?\n3. We need to understand the regulatory climate on the electric side and the implications for electric generation demand growth.\n4. We need to understand electric tariffs and practices, services, and OASIS because the FERC has started to insist on common rules between gas and electric. The recent electric interconnection policy has now been applied on the gas side; FERC is talking about imposing RTO principles on pipelines, and we hear a lot of comparisons between OASIS and pipeline EBBS. We want to learn how to take advantage of electric best practices where it makes sense and on the flip side know how to argue against the imposition of electric rules on our pipelines where there are legitimate differences between gas and electric.\nPlease feel free to email me with any other areas of interest for the course. I will keep you posted on the specific location as things progress. In the meantime, please make sure to save the date. Please pass this notice along to others in your organization that may be interested."

    "body": "The El Paso Energy Corp is progressing towards acquiring PG&E Corporation's Texas gathering and liquids businesses for approximately $1.05 billion in stock and debt. The deal, which includes natural gas transmission pipelines, processing plants, and a natural gas storage field, was facilitated by a consent agreement signed this week. \n\nPG&E National Energy Group purchased the properties about three years ago for $3 billion but struggled to turn a profit. The basis between Waha in West Texas and Katy and the Houston ship channel has tightened since the purchase, making it difficult for PG&E to become a major player in the market.\n\nThe assets, which also include significant natural gas liquids pipelines and fractionation facilities, serve all of Texas's major metropolitan areas, large industrial load centers, and several natural gas trading hubs. Before the sale to El Paso, the book value of these assets was estimated between $4-6 billion.\n\nBefore buying PG&E's assets, El Paso was already an experienced player in the liquids game. Upon the completion of this deal, El Paso expects to actively manage the risk on the nonfee-based side as part of its normal review process.\n\nThe consent agreement signed this week is subject to approval by the Federal Trade Commission and a similar agreement with the state of Texas. Once these agreements are approved, El Paso Energy expects to close the transaction in the fourth quarter."

To summarize, we may terminate the agreement by giving 30 days prior written notice to Burlington. This applies under the Operating Base Agreement (OBA) paragraph if the OBA is terminated and also under the Interconnect Point Operating Agreement paragraph upon expiration of the primary term or in the event that the OBA between the parties is terminated. However, as you mentioned, termination of the agreement could have significant customer relation implications and should be considered an extreme measure.

    "body": "The senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Gordon Smith (R-OR) have announced a bipartisan partnership to introduce legislation addressing the Western energy crisis. The proposed bill aims to restore stability and reliability to the western energy market by directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to impose a temporary just and reasonable wholesale rate cap or cost-of-service based rates. Additionally, states involved will be required to pass on the cost of electricity to retail customers. However, they can determine how and when this would be done. For instance, California could opt for tiered pricing, real-time pricing, or set a baseline rate above which prices would be passed through. \n\nSenator Feinstein stated that FERC has found the wholesale prices being charged in California to be unjust and unreasonable. This legislation aims to mandate that once FERC makes such a finding, the agency will carry out its regulatory role. FERC is a million-dollar agency tasked with regulating the energy marketplace, and this bill seeks to provide a period of reliability and stability during a crisis. Unfortunately, FERC has refused to act in this regard. \n\nCalifornia's broken electricity market is a result of a flawed California law that deregulated wholesale costs but left in place caps on retail prices. This was coupled with a requirement that utilities divest themselves of their generating capacity and buy most of their electricity on the spot market where prices have escalated dramatically. In hindsight, this combination has led to a catastrophic scenario, resulting in California buying electricity at astronomical prices today."

      "body": "The email discusses the current crisis in California's power market. The root cause of the problem is a lack of new generation, and the high cost of power incurred by California's utilities. The current credit crisis threatens supplies and may lead to state action to address the situation. The focus should be on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible. Western power prices have skyrocketed, and regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms due to frozen rates that insulate consumers from tangible effects of the market crisis. This has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market."

It appears that while some issues were discussed, substantive matters such as the battle between Full Requirements (FR) and Contract Demand (CD) shippers, the proposed conversion of FR shippers to CD contracts, and the impact of moving from six to pools remained unaddressed. Furthermore, there was no decision on whether a hearing or settlement would be pursued for a final decision. It's worth noting that additional allocation studies have been requested by shippers to better understand the impacts of seasonalization, winter and summer conditions, and the difference between CD and FR requirements. It seems that El Paso interprets their studies as showing the proposed capacity allocation method is workable, but shippers remain skeptical. Lastly, there was a question raised about whether shippers could designate specific receipt points rather than pools. It's important to clarify commission policy on pools vs receipt points and address the procedural schedule for further studies and responses. I will ensure this information is shared with the relevant parties."

1. SOCAL will not set the capacity at Needles lower than necessary, unless they encounter operational problems. However, they will maintain the capacity for a gas day during all cycles. This is good news for both SOCAL and TW.

2. SOCAL may set a capacity higher than usual if they do so, they will maintain that capacity for a gas day during all cycles only in case of specific operational problems. This is also beneficial for TW and SOCAL.

3. Starting from November, SOCAL can call an Operational Flow Order (OFO) at the beginning of each cycle for the gas day. This could potentially cause a confirmation reduction. From now on, they can call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle including intraday and intraday cycles which are part of the gas day. This is expected to have a major impact on SOCAL's customers.

4. Despite the windowing supposedly being removed, SOCAL will still provide a capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations exceed their capacity.

5. If SOCAL reduces scheduled volumes after an allocation, it will be due to their market not burning their schedule at that time.

6. SOCAL will confirm down to the market burn overall.

Our focus remains on credit quality, balance sheet, and liquidity, which are crucial for continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.\n3. It has taken more than a few weeks to reach our current state, and here's a brief overview of significant events that led us here.\n4. Unfortunately, we made some poor investments in non-core businesses over the past years, such as Azurix India and Brazil. These investments have underperformed significantly.\n5. As a result, we have become overleveraged as a company. The negative impact of these investments was amplified through extensive use of debt capital on and off our balance sheet, related party transactions, and loss of investor confidence.\n6. We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures.\n7. Last week, we discovered errors in our financial statements that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.\n8. Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They are our competitive advantage, including natural gas pipeline businesses, gas and power businesses in North America and Europe, retail businesses in North America and Europe, and coal businesses in North America and Europe.\n9. The events of the past few weeks have temporarily impacted our projected fourth-quarter profitability, but it's too early to predict the long-term effect on our operating results.\n10. We are taking actions to quickly return to normal business operations.\n\nRegarding non-core businesses:\n11. These include our Global Assets Group and Broadband Division, which we have invested more than $1 billion in. The return from these businesses has been poor.\n12. We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses.\n13. More than $1 billion worth of assets are already contracted for sale this year, including Ceg Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil, Ecoelectrica (a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico), and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India.\n14. The approximately $1 billion Portland General sale is also on track to close pending regulatory approvals.\n\nRegarding businesses under review:\nThese operations are outside our Power and Gas Wholesale Businesses and include Global and Industrial Markets. While several of these businesses have strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient in terms of earnings and cash generation.\n\nWe will continue to update you regularly as more information becomes available.\n\nCredit Filing:\nWe continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies. We believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment-grade credit rating.\n\nOur current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:\n- Moody's: Under Review for Further Downgrade\n- Fitch: BBB Evolving Status, CreditWatch Negative\n- S&P: Not specified in the email.\n\nWe discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin, and Yosemite, in detail. We will file our report five days late due to our current activities, which will be filed on Nov [date not specified].\n\nPlease note that investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available because it will contain important information.\n\nBest Regards,\n[Your Name]"

       "body": "Dear Team,\n\nAs many of you know, we closed on Dynegy's option to acquire Northern Natural yesterday. A more comprehensive message about that transaction and its implications will be distributed soon.\n\nOne important requirement under this transaction is that Operations Services Company has agreed to continue providing certain services to Northern, consistent with our past operations. Northern will be billed for these services, and we will be required to demonstrate the basis for those billings, effective Feb 1st. Therefore, all employees in the ETS family of companies who perform any services for Northern or are related to Northern's operations in any way should keep timesheets documenting the amount of time spent on Northern projects or supporting personnel and activities related to Northern projects.\n\nIf there are any questions about this requirement, please communicate with your department head or with me. Thank you for your help in implementing this important requirement.\n\nBest,\nJim"

However, no definitive timeline for installing the GC Del Mar dewpoint instrument or building has been provided yet. Rich and Earl are reportedly working on it. The lack of power and positive shut-in or overpressure protection at the location is still an issue. I will inform everyone about any changes and updates, such as the addition of a new well."

       "body": "The California power market is currently in a critical situation, with negotiations between government and industry ongoing. The principals are expected to meet by videoconference over the weekend to review solutions developed by staff working groups. Governor Gray Davis has announced that he expects to have something to announce early next week. In the meantime, emergency legislation is making its way through the state capital. Notably, Diane Feinstein has proposed a bill to allow the energy secretary to impose price caps. The governors of California, Oregon, and Washington are also working together to establish a regional strategy on joint energy conversations, supply cooperation, and seasonal energy sharing. Governor Davis is optimistic that this problem will be resolved in the near future."
