      "body": "Dear Max,\n\nThank you for your email. I understand that Steve has provided a partial answer to some of your questions, and we would like to set a time for Wednesday afternoon to discuss further. We are currently reviewing our capability to deliver the MHQ in an hourly block, and it does not seem to be any problem at this point. However, we are working through the hydraulic studies to verify and quantify the plant's complete hourly capability.\n\nIf you are receiving gas from both TW and EPNG, and for some reason EPNG shuts off deliveries, we can model the impact of delivering all the plant's requirements for known durations. The contract rate will be a negotiated rate, which eliminates rate risk for Gila.\n\nThe rate design is currently one-part with no differentiation between reservation and commodity. The rate does not include ACA GRI surcharges or fuel; it covers only a minimal return on the projects capital cost plus ongoing O&M fuel costs. The fuel was set with the shippers in the rate case, and the offer to Panda is consistent with the current tariff.\n\nAs the term gets shorter, the rate by necessity goes up to cover the return hurdles and delivery pressure at the Panda EPNG interconnect should be a minimum capacity of the lateral from Copper Eagle to EPNG. If an alternative receiver is required, we can discuss our thoughts here: if Panda is willing to commit to taking capacity in the project, then TW would give you all the necessary flexibility to move gas to other destinations at the contract rate for instance, Panda would be paying a one-part rate for delivery to the plant. If for some reason, plant demand was reduced, you would have all the flexibility to move gas to alternative markets.\n\nWe have to plan for the worst case scenario and assume there is no storage with this in mind. TW will have some flexibility just due to the size of the project pipe and pressure, but this will depend on what other shippers are doing. Again, we are modelling the hydraulics.\n\nLooking forward to speaking with you soon.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]"

It appears that the California send out numbers are indeed pushing the envelope, and the collective situation with SOCAL and PG&E withdrawing over BCFD is concerning. As predicted in a gas-short marketplace, this shortage seems to be exacerbated and may worsen in the next few years, especially with the addition of the new EOC power plants. It's crucial to note that the power generated by these plants might primarily serve native markets rather than the CA ISO-PX with its price cap feature.

    1. You start with two cows.
    2. You sell one cow, buy a bull to grow your herd. The economy grows due to the increased productivity.
    3. You sell the cows (and possibly the bull) to a publicly listed company, using debt and equity swaps and other financial instruments.
    4. You regain ownership of some or all of the cows with tax benefits.
    5. The milk rights are transferred offshore, sold back to the company, and reported as owning more cows than you actually do.

This expansion could potentially alleviate the pipeline capacity crunch in the western United States, particularly in the California gas market. The prospect was raised by Daniel M Adamson, Director of FERC's Office of Energy Projects, in a letter to El Paso. El Paso has proposed several ways this expansion could be achieved, including adding compression to the proposed line project, replacing or recommissioning existing compression, or adding new compression to its existing system. The preferred method will be determined by a cost analysis and identifying where shippers want the capacity. El Paso has already posted BCFD of California-bound pipeline capacity for sale effective June of this year. If there is an unmet demand for additional capacity on its system, El Paso may conduct another open season to solicit expressions of interest in additional pipeline capacity.

We are requesting permission and approval to abandon in-place existing units totaling HP at Transwestern's Stations and install a HP unit at each station.\n\nThis project is expected to result in MCFD of incremental firm capacity from Thoreau to the California border. Due to the urgent nature of this request, we are asking for expedited treatment with an order issued by August. \n\nAttached are photographs of the station yards, additional agency correspondence including a cultural resource survey for each station, and an updated landowner listing.\n\nWe would like to clarify that no aquifers will be affected by this project, and the new and existing units will not operate simultaneously during the six-month transition period after the installation of the new units. \n\nOn April 1st, we filed a cultural resource survey for each station, NOAA clearance for the stations, and revised noise analysis reports incorporating the power generators at each station.\n\nOn May 1st, we received SHPO approval contingent upon avoidance of a site identified at one station. We also received correspondence from the Navajo Nation Archaeology Department stating they are waiting for internal documentation before issuing a clearance letter for that same station. \n\nOn May 15th, we received NNAD approval for the station.\n\nAdditional firm transportation agreements representing DTH will be filed with FERC on June 1st. Further firm agreements for DTH were filed on July 1st, bringing the total subscribed capacity to DTH.\n\nOn July 5th, we filed a schedule showing the daily deliveries to SoCal Needles from April through June.\n\nLastly, we have filed an affirmative statement pursuant to the condition of the order on July 5th. \n\nWe look forward to your review and prompt action.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"

       "body": "Here's CERA's monthly forecast. October differentials at Chicago are predicted to be higher due to supply anxiety. The gas market is exposed to a potential supply shortfall late in the winter even under normal weather conditions, which has placed a floor on the gas price at the price of residual fuel oil itself priced in the mid to upper range. Gas prices moving into this range would begin to attract demand back into the market. Diverting supplies from storage and increasing supply concerns again. There is little demand response to price until industrial demand lessens or the price of distillate oil, as of this writing near $2.30 per million British thermal units (mmbtu), is breached. However, distillate markets themselves are extremely tight and prices for that fuel would likely follow gas prices up within this range. Prices are defined mainly by supply and judgment of the likelihood of a supply shortfall, which would be characterized by extreme pricing and volatility and a difficult process of supply allocation by price. By now exposure to extreme price volatility this winter is certain although CERA expects storage injections to increase by approximately 1 Bcf per day from August to September, this increase would still leave inventories at record lows for this month and next even this increase in injections will not occur if a tropical storm forces evacuation of offshore platforms or if hot weather returns for October. Heating load enters the picture with us supplies running close to year-earlier levels. CERA's autumn roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at [this link](link_to_website)."

      "body": "Thank you for your email regarding transport options in response to the FERC filing. Here's a brief summary:

1. The technical conference has been scheduled in Washington DC for January.
2. We hedged MMBtud of fuel for the calendar year and unwound it the following day as the market dipped, resulting in a small gain. We anticipate prices to jump again next week due to the oncoming cold snap.
3. Regarding PNMs request for transport proposal, our response left the current rate structure in place but includes two additional tiers of volumetric incentive pricing as their volume increases. Their rates will go down with increased volumes, and we've also added a seasonal IT rate to meet any swing gas demand requirements.
4. Albuquerque Lateral ENA is meeting with IPP plant owners in the Albuquerque region who are interested in alternative sources of gas supply. If they expand the plant from a peaking unit to a combined-cycle unit, there may be potential for a new delivery lateral off TWS mainline. This deal structure could include a volume incentive rate as throughput increases in the lateral.
5. The next step for TWS is to build a rate matrix under several different operating scenarios. Responses are due to ENA by Friday.
6. The Black Mesa Project is still being evaluated. Converting the Black Mesa coal slurry line owned by Northern Border into gas service could increase our capacity to bring San Juan gas to the California border and potentially provide a positive environmental play for Black Mesa and coal slurry, affecting areas like the Grand Canyon. This project is contingent on several factors, including working with Mohave Generating Station majority owner AES to convert the plant to gas and working with the Navajo who could lose a large export market for their coal. ENA has agreed to approach AES on this project in the near future once their negotiations on the Las Vegas power plant are complete.
7. Legal is checking the existing ROW to see if there are limitations on the pipe usage.
8. We are assembling the volume and revenue impact figures of the November train derailment for submission to Burlington's claims adjusters. This will be combined with the total operations costs."

Unfortunately, APS was not a bidder in the IOS last week, and we rejected their offer. However, they agreed to an IT Agreement for MMBTUD on the Crawford Lateral.\n\n2. New Shipper: A new shipper on TW will generate additional revenue starting from September. This is an East-to-East deal at plus fuel.\n\n3. Contract Extensions: Duke FT has agreed to extend its contract from Red Cedar to Blanco from January through December.\n\n4. Verbal Agreement: We have a verbal agreement with Red Cedar for a year deal, with final details being negotiated. The volume would range between MMBTUD.\n\n5.

FT Agreement: Sempra has agreed to an FT Agreement for Ignacio to Blanco for MMBTUD, with a term of Calendar Q.\n\n7. Space Availability: We have approximately MMBTUD of remaining space available.\n\n8. Production Limitation: Burlington Resources claims we are limiting production from their Val Verde plant because TW is unable to fully accept all the nominations of gas under the current operating agreement, resulting in approximately $ in lost revenues.\n\n9. Data Collection: We are pulling together data on exactly which days we have not been able to take BR's gas thus far. BR has rejected our revised wording in the interconnect amendment specifically best efforts and subject to operating conditions on TW.\n\n10. Amendment Negotiation: We will need to revise this further as they do not think our offered alternate receipt point flexibility at Ignacio and alternate delivery point flexibility at El Paso Blanco on their jackrabbit contract is sufficient to agree to amend the interconnect agreement.\n\n11. Discount Suggestion: They have suggested we consider giving them a deeper discount on their San Juan Waha contract term, but this is not acceptable to TW.\n\n12. Evaluation: We are evaluating all options regarding the situation with Southwest Gas who will soon be capable of receiving gas through the new interconnect in Nevada under the terms of the agreement.\n\n13.

I'll break down the information into digestible points for better understanding:\n\n1. The sale of MMBTUD of daily firm space moving gas from PGE Topock to Socal Needles is underway, given the unique price spreads in California.\n2. We are also discussing potential participation in a gas storage field on Navajo land near Farmington NM, where third-party developers require our assistance.\n3. The development of Transwestern's hourly firm service has been delayed until power plant loads become operational. During this interim period, Park n Ride services provided intraday will be priced higher than those provided on a timely basis.\n4. El Paso El Paso Merchant Services needs to reconsider their verbal offer for a million lump sum prepayment option of fuel monetization for their combined MMBTUD of San Juan to California capacity. The original offer did not consider the different termination dates of the two contracts.\n5. A revised proposed lump sum payment offer is expected mid-next week.\n6. El Paso Field Services met with EP representatives to discuss a possible interconnect near the IC, sized for MMBTUD. EP proposes to pay for and set compression to flow this gas into our high pressure line, committing to a volume of MMBTUD for up to years.\n7. An added advantage is that most of the volume would come from the constrained Atoka area, allowing Agave to increase deliveries to TW.\n8. Caithness Corp has decided to move forward on their MW generation project in Northwest Arizona, initially consuming MMBTUD of gas. The proposed location is miles south of TWS line near Wickieup AZ.\n9. We are meeting with Caithness Reps next week, and the projected inservice date for the plant is early Cooler Expansion Level B.\n10. Cost estimates are being prepared for this project, and revenue cost savings assumptions predict annual revenue to support the expenditure once installed.\n\nOnce we receive the cost estimate, financial evaluations will be done. I hope this breakdown helps clarify the updates provided in your email. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification. Best regards."

1. The importance of safety: We acknowledge the oversight that led to this incident and reiterate our commitment to safety as our top priority. We will take steps to reinforce this principle among all our staff.

2. Procedure adherence: The senior OM tech involved in the incident has been disciplined for failing to follow procedures, including gas testing, confined space entry, excavation and work permits, blowdown and purging, event notification sequence, spills and releases, damage prevention, and proper use of maps when marking pipelines.

3. Improvements in procedures: We will review and revise our operating procedures to ensure that team members use all available resources to clearly identify existing pipelines as active or abandoned. We will also clarify the unacceptable practice of drilling into a pipeline to determine if it is abandoned.

4. Preexisting abandoned pipe removal: In the future, when a preexisting abandoned pipeline must be removed, local management will contact the engineering department for guidance. Abandoned pipelines that will not be removed shall be treated as active pipelines and marked accordingly.

5. Near misses investigation: The Pipeline Safety Department is investigating why the GPG facility was not identified on the April onecall ticket. We are taking steps to minimize such near misses in the future.

6. Continuous improvement: We will review our practices for reporting and responding to incidents, including the release of natural gas, to ensure prompt action and communication with relevant parties."

Some users may have experienced problems launching the site or enrolling; we apologize for any inconvenience and suggest that you use Internet Explorer or Netscape for a smoother experience, especially if you are using the Lotus Notes web browser as your default. The original message regarding the PAC is provided below: Last year, the PAC launched a campaign to become a million-dollar PAC, with employees providing all of the funding. The PAC reached its objective and became one of the largest corporate PACs. This year we face new challenges due to the sale of EOG, the announced sale of PG&E, and regular employee turnover. We are seeking your support if you are not a member, please join; if you are a member, we hope you will consider increasing your contribution. The PAC is an essential tool in our effort to promote sound public policy. Our PAC funds support local, state, and federal candidates of both parties who support open markets, deregulation, and customer choice. Contributions may be used to make political contributions in connection with federal and state elections and are subject to the limits of the Federal Election Campaign Act. While our PAC has grown thanks to employee contributions, it still generates just a fraction of the expenditures of those who oppose these ideals. This year we face challenges and opportunities for every one of our businesses, including issues such as taxation, e-commerce industry restructuring, regulation of derivatives, international trade and investment legislation, pipeline safety, local and state decisions affecting the siting and interconnection of power plants, and a variety of environmental and tax issues. The PAC has a long and successful track record of supporting and advancing good public policy; this track record depends on access to and regular communication with decision-makers. The PAC provides that access, showing policy makers that real voters care about what they are doing. The PAC challenges the status quo, asks why things are done a certain way, and helps us change them. We need your help to continue this important work; sign up today or revise your current contribution level by connecting with the PAC intranet com."

It's good to hear that despite the ongoing system maintenance, gas control has been able to increase TWS West flow and schedule deliveries at max rates from Topock to Needles. The slight increase will be helpful in making up for the greater decrease in volume due to DOT mandated reduced operating pressures during the safety digouts in early May.\n\nThe reduction of mMBTUD to the border during that period is expected, but we appreciate the information about the Atoka Lateral test and the collaboration with Agave Petroleum. The reconfiguration of gas flow at the Atoka station should help optimize resources around the system.\n\nRegarding the collaboration with Oneok Westar, it's interesting to learn that they are working towards making the existing Ward County TX delivery point a high-volume bidirectional point by installing additional pipe. The ability to flow mMBTUD into TWS high pressure line will certainly free up some compressor capacity for gas flowing to Texas intrastate lines.\n\nThank you for keeping us informed about these developments.

The $1 billion expansion project began in August of this year, as increased rocky mountain natural gas supplies created a need for additional pipeline transportation infrastructure. The expansion project includes installing two new compressor stations and adding additional horsepower at an existing compressor station. Additionally, El Paso Corp affiliate, Trailblazer Gas Co, is expected to become an equity owner in Trailblazer when the additional capacity comes online."

       "body": "The Aux Sable plant, part of the Alliance Pipeline system, has experienced some delays in commissioning due to ongoing issues with debris in the pipe and integration problems with concurrent commissioning activities at the Aux Sable liquid products processing facility near Chicago. The commercial in-service date has been pushed back to the end of November for the third time. This delay is attributed to continued problems with debris, mostly foam coming off equipment used during hydrostatic testing, and the complexity of the pipeline system that includes an intricate network designed to transport gas liquids. Currently, the pipeline is flowing a large amount of gas into the Chicago market at approximately 20% of capacity, and it's expected to increase the volume of test gas and approach its firm delivery capacity of 1 Bcf per day before the end of November."

      "body": "The email contains several questions regarding negotiated rate agreements for a new MMD expansion, cafeteria-style menu of options for prospective customers, and allocation of capacity if demand exceeds supply. Here are the answers to the questions as I understand them:

      1. Can TW use negotiated rate agreements for its new MMD expansion? Yes, they can, but they must always offer cost-based recourse rate service as an alternative.
      2. Can they give prospective customers a cafeteria-style menu of options? Yes, they can define specific negotiated rate options and stick to them. However, it's important to ensure that they can enforce a 'no substitutions' policy to maintain structure in the negotiated rate approach.
      3. How much flexibility do they have in structuring the options? They should have discretion in how to structure their negotiated rate options, but they must be careful not to be second-guessed by FERC as to whether they should have offered a different option instead.
      4. Can they slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a better deal than the recourse option for most shippers? It's possible, but they need to be careful not to discriminate against other customers.
      5. How do they allocate capacity if demand exceeds supply? Ideally, they would allocate it to the guys who want to buy it in the way they prefer to sell it. However, they must cover the recourse demand first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else.
      6. Can they sell to the guys who want option 'Y' years and the remaining to the guys that really choke the recourse bidders? They may need to consider filling the recourse rate guys orders first, and then giving the remaining capacity to the neg rate guys whose bids they value most highly using some objective non-discriminatory calculation.
      7. Is it necessary to get MEKM on the phone to discuss these questions? It would be beneficial to discuss these questions with them at your convenience as they might have more specific insights or information."

      "body": "The email discusses the expected increase in home heating costs this winter due to strong economic growth and high crude oil prices. Here are some key points: \n\n- Homes using natural gas can expect to see the biggest jump in bills, with prices paid by residential customers averaging $3.50 per mmbtu compared to last winter's average of $2.70.\n- For homes using heating oil, the cost will be approximately $2.80 per gallon this winter, up from last winter's price of $2.40 per gallon.\n- The cost of propane for homes is expected to increase by about 50% this winter compared to last year, with inventories being roughly 3 million barrels above last year's level.\n- Distillate stockpiles (heating oil and diesel fuel) will be lower than last year, with stocks in the northeast being particularly low.\n\nThe email also mentions that the monthly price of crude oil is expected to remain above $100 per barrel for the rest of the year before gradually declining next year. It notes that global oil demand is expected to increase this year and will continue growing in 2023 and 2024.\n\nFinally, the email suggests that a very cold winter could cause heating oil prices in the northeast to surge, potentially affecting east coast diesel markets. The chances of this happening are considered greater this year due to tight distillate supplies, particularly in the northeast."

Transporter call volumes tracking system may require updates.\n5. System changes for capacity release and invoice system adjustments will likely be necessary.\n6.

      "body": "Raymond James & Associates predicts an average of double-digit gas prices this winter, and even into next year. They expect regional shortfalls in gas supply due to low storage levels, possibly leading to all-time low levels this winter. According to their report, the U.S. will likely see a gas demand increase by about 4 Bcf/d as new gas-fired electric generation plants come online. However, they forecast that domestic production will only increase by less than 2 Bcf/d by the end of this year, meaning that gas prices must rise to crimp over 1 Bcf/d of demand out of the supply-demand equation. This suggests that gas prices must go higher in the coming years. Other analysts are also raising their forecasts, with the first call consensus at $3.25, but Raymond James' prediction is significantly higher. Deutsche Bank believes that the current predictions by analysts and futures market participants might be too bold."

Other assets include the Casper and Douglas Gas Gathering and Processing Systems, KMI's interest in Coyote Gas Treating, and KMI's interest in Thunder Creek Gas Services. In return, KMI will receive $1.35 billion in cash and KMP partnership units. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. \n\nRich Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan, stated that this transaction benefits both KMI and KMP as the pipeline assets are a good fit for KMP due to their long-term contracts in place and significant growth opportunities. Because the consideration paid will include equity issued to KMI, there will be no need to raise funds via a public offering of KMP units. \n\nKMI will also benefit from the transaction as it will reduce its debt by $1 billion and is expected to be modestly accretive to KMI's earnings per share. Upon closing, KMP will have completed over $2.75 billion in acquisitions in 2021, boosting KMI's total asset contribution to KMP to more than $14 billion - far exceeding the original goal stipulated when Kinder Morgan merged with KN Energy last July."

    "body": "Dear Jeff,\n\nPreliminary comments on Transwestern's Transport Option Program:\n\n1. Top market-based rates: If Transwestern intends to offer a top service without a corresponding cost-based recourse service, they would need to make a filing that demonstrates a lack of market power comparable to the extent that they implement a top service.\n\n2. Call Put Capability in the Capacity Release Market: It would be highly advisable to provide that other FT holders be able to offer a similar call put capability in the capacity release market. This would likely require specific changes to the capacity release sections in order to allow prospective capacity releases with a call or put pricing option.\n\n3. Manipulation and Market Power: The top service should not be a means for any party, particularly an affiliate, to manipulate the transportation market and/or exert market power by withholding capacity. The top service should require sufficient protections to ensure continued undiminished service to all of Transwestern's existing and future FT customers.\n\n4. Standardization: The terms and conditions for the top service should be standardized in order that each top service offer is not considered a nonconforming contract under FERC policy. The call and put options and any administrative or operating limitations should be specifically defined.\n\n5. Non-Preferential: Transwestern must ensure that the top service is offered and administered in a manner that is fair and equitable and in a manner that does not convey a preferential right to any party, particularly an affiliate. Whether the top is a cost or market-based rate, there will be a question as to where the revenue goes.\n\n6. Pilot Program: Given the precedential nature of this proposal, perhaps the industry would be more comfortable with the top if it were filed as an experimental program on Transwestern with a finite life. This would allow parties to gain experience prior to having all of the pipelines and others file for similar authority.\n\nThanks again for inviting us to lunch yesterday. Both Teddy and I found it to be very helpful and informative. We look forward to a more detailed description of your proposal and the ability to discuss it with Transwestern in a future customer meeting."

In brief, Nevada Power Company has agreed to sell the Sunrise Station Electric Generating Plant in Las Vegas, NV to Reliant Energy Power Generation Inc., a subsidiary of Reliant Energy REI.\n\nThe sale includes two generating units owned by Nevada Power and rights to electricity produced by three additional units on the Sunrise site owned by an independent power producer. The sale price is $80 million (subject to taxes and other adjustments at closing).\n\nConcurrently with the purchase, Nevada Power has negotiated the right to buy energy and ancillary services from Reliant Energy Power Generation for agreed upon prices from closing until March, at a cost of $40 million based on the time of closing. This will result in a net price for the generating plant upon closing of approximately $120 million.\n\nWith the sale of Sunrise Station and the divestiture of our generation assets nearly complete, we will soon be able to devote all our resources to building the best energy transmission and distribution company in the west. Reliant Energy is a leader in power generation and has already established a strong presence in southern Nevada.\n\nSunrise Station consists of two generating units that can be fueled by natural gas or oil, capable of producing up to 800 MW of electricity. The facility also includes three additional gas turbine generating units rated at 300 MW each, owned by an independent power producer, Nevada Sunpeak Limited Partnership under contract to Nevada Power.\n\nThe sale is expected to close in Q1 20XX (subject to approval and review by various regulatory agencies). The company intends to complete the sale and transfer of all its generating assets in Nevada by this time. Credit Suisse First Boston acted as financial advisor to Sierra Pacific Resources on the Sunrise Station sale, and Navigant Consulting served as the technical advisor.\n\nHeadquartered in Nevada, Sierra Pacific Resources is a holding company whose principal subsidiaries are Nevada Power Company (the electric utility for southern Nevada), Sierra Pacific Power Company (the electric utility for most of northern Nevada and the Lake Tahoe area of California), and a natural gas and water distributor in the Reno-Sparks area. Other subsidiaries include the Tuscarora Gas Pipeline Company, which owns a percent interest in an interstate natural gas transmission partnership, and Sierra Pacific Communications, a telecommunications company.\n\nReliant Energy and a partner jointly own and operate El Dorado Energy, a natural gas-fired facility southeast of Las Vegas. In October 20XX, Reliant Energy announced plans to construct a natural gas-fired power plant about miles north of Las Vegas off Interstate 15. Based in Houston, Texas, Reliant Energy is an international energy services and energy delivery company with $XX billion in annual revenue and assets totaling $YY billion.\n\nThis press release is being sent out as a bulk mailer.

   }, This text is a summary about the city of Houston, Texas. It highlights three main characteristics of Houston that contribute to its unique identity:

   1. Cheap Land and Low Taxes: Houston has maintained an industrial growth model based on cheap land, low taxes, immigrant labor, and unfettered pro-business policies. This model has been successful in attracting businesses and fostering economic development. However, it may not be sustainable in the long term as the city faces challenges related to pollution, quality of life, and education.

   2. Diversity: Houston is a multiracial city that has undergone significant demographic changes over the years. It was originally a biracial town with a large black minority, but now its population is roughly one-third white, one-third black, and slightly over one-third brown. This rapid transition from a biracial to a multiracial city has been peaceful and reflects the city's racial tolerance.

   3. Civic Mindedness: Houston has a tradition of civic-minded business leaders who are closely tied to the city's fate. One example is Kenneth Lay, former Enron CEO, who has been involved in various city projects. This active involvement of business leaders in city affairs sets Houston apart from other growing cities.

The text also mentions some challenges that Houston faces:
- Pollution: The city is working to improve its air quality to attract skilled workers.
- Sprawl and Zoning: As the city continues to grow outwards, there are concerns about whether it can continue to do so while attracting the skilled people whose jobs are downtown. This may require introducing zoning laws.
- Education: Houston's education system is struggling, particularly with regards to graduation rates among Latino students, which is concerning given the increasing importance of education for accessing good jobs in today's economy.

Overall, Houston is a city that has undergone significant transformations and is currently thriving due to its unique blend of cheap land, low taxes, immigrant labor, and civic-minded business leaders. However, it faces challenges related to pollution, sprawl, and education that will need to be addressed in the coming years., {

      "body": "The email discusses concerns about changes proposed by Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission (KMIGT) in their tariff filing. The changes, according to the customers, aim to avoid a more rigorous review and comment process, as they allegedly include provisions that affect imbalance, storage balances, small customer service, gas quality point allocations, curtailment priorities, right of first refusal scheduling priorities, incidental purchase and sale capacity release, unauthorized gas capacity rights, overrun charges, and miscellaneous items. \n\nAdditionally, the customers are concerned about changes that would give KMIGT discretion in making decisions regarding negative storage imbalances and end of season inventory swaps, as well as changes to the default methodology for point allocations for billing purposes and the injection of KMIGT's discretion into the formula for accepting or rejecting predetermined allocation agreements with upstream or downstream parties. \n\nFurthermore, the customers argue that the curtailment provisions filed by KMIGT are contrary to the order mandate and would give the pipeline the opportunity to bottle up significant quantities of coal bed methane gas in Wyoming's Powder River Basin by imposing more rigorous standards on nitrogen content. This could potentially limit downstream pipeline egress out of the Powder River production areas, as six of the seven connecting pipelines identified have no nitrogen specifications, only KMIGT's affiliate Natural Gas Pipeline Co of America has similar rules. The customers also suggest that these changes could create a temporary gap in the downstream movement of coal bed supplies to midcontinent and eastern markets, thereby frustrating consumer access to these significant supplies."

During his employment, Morris has been required to close, move, and establish field offices throughout the United States. He has also been involved in reorganizing and developing new ETS business units. Morris is an important leader in ETS.\n\n- Rick, a Construction Coordinator in Amarillo, was instrumental in the Kansas Aline Abandonment project. He ensured that affected landowners and the construction contractor were treated fairly. In one instance, he traveled several hundred miles to have a face-to-face discussion with a group of landowners to ensure that the project would be completed without adverse environmental impact. Rick's effort diffused a potentially large and expensive problem.\n\n- Bob, an Account Director in Houston, explains complex transactions and details about ecosystems with great ease. His prudent, careful, and adept professional customer dealings are among the best. Bob is a true asset to our customers and employees.\n\n- Gary, an Engineering Specialist in Omaha, is always looking for a more efficient way of doing work.

       "body": "The FERC has issued a series of remedial measures in response to California's power market crisis. These actions aim to stabilize the market by virtually stripping CalPX and CAISO of their control, allowing for bilateral contracts in the forward market, and scheduling a settlement conference in December for parties involved in California's power market to negotiate these contracts. \n\nThe FERC order removes the requirement that California utilities buy and sell exclusively through CalPX, clears the way for bilateral contracts, and calls for a benchmark price for wholesale bilateral contracts. It also introduces penalties for underscheduling power loads, market monitoring and price mitigation for the CAISO and CalPX spot markets, and replaces the current CalISO stakeholder governing board with a non-stakeholder board.\n\nThe FERC's actions have been met with criticism from California utilities such as PGE, who argue that the remedies do not go far enough to ensure electric supply reliability and protect customers from price gouging. They have also requested retroactive price refunds for California customers."
   }, In response to your question, here are some economic factors that could determine where a power plant developer might choose to build a plant and connect it to the grid:

1. Energy Market Structure: The type of market structure (e.g., competitive wholesale markets, regulated monopolies) in the regions where the developer is considering building the plant can impact the profitability of the project. For example, in a competitive market, developers may face lower barriers to entry but also have to compete with other generators for market share.

2. Transmission Access: The ease of accessing the transmission system and the cost of doing so are critical factors. Developers will want to build plants near existing transmission lines or areas where new lines are planned, as this can reduce construction costs and improve the plant's ability to sell its output.

3. Regulatory Environment: State and federal regulations can significantly impact a developer's decision about where to build a plant. For example, stricter environmental regulations may make it more costly or difficult to build plants in some regions. Similarly, policies that promote renewable energy may create opportunities for developers in those areas.

4. Fuel Costs: The cost and availability of fuel are crucial factors in the economic viability of a power plant. Developers will want to build where fuel is abundant and relatively cheap. In the case of natural gas, this might mean building near existing pipelines or areas with shale gas reserves.

5. Load Growth: Developers will also consider the rate of load growth in the regions they are considering. If demand for electricity is growing rapidly, there may be more opportunities to build new plants and sell power.

6. Transmission Congestion: Transmission congestion can impact a developer's ability to sell their output at competitive prices. Developers will want to avoid building plants in areas with high levels of transmission congestion if possible.

7. Incentives/Subsidies: State and federal incentives or subsidies for renewable energy or other types of generation can influence a developer's decision about where to build a plant. For example, a state may offer tax credits or grants for projects that use renewable energy sources.

Regarding your question about the Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) rule and why it matters, RTOs are organizations responsible for operating regional electric grids in a manner that ensures reliability, promotes competition, and encourages the efficient use of resources. The development of an effective RTO network can promote efficiency, market transparency, and stimulate competition in the electric industry, ultimately leading to lower costs for consumers.

As for whether gas has killed the gas-fired power market, it's a complex issue with multiple factors at play. Gas prices are indeed a critical factor, but they are not the only one. Other factors include policy considerations (e.g., environmental regulations), technological advancements, and changes in consumer behavior.

In some cases, gas-fired power plants may no longer be economical due to low natural gas prices or more cost-effective alternatives like renewable energy sources. However, gas will continue to play a role in the electric industry, especially as a flexible resource that can help balance the grid and provide backup power when needed. The future of the gas-fired power market will depend on how these various factors continue to evolve over time.

As for your question about building a power plant in New Mexico and connecting it to the grid in California, there are several economic and regulatory factors that would need to be considered. For example, transmission access and costs, fuel transportation costs, state-specific regulations, and market conditions in both states would all play a role in determining the viability of such a project. A thorough analysis would be required to make an informed decision about whether this is a viable option., {

We can confirm that the facilities were sold to Duke some time ago, and the only thing that exists on our TW system for this subject is a side valve that is currently disconnected from the measuring facilities. \n\nShould your prospective producer be interested in connecting to our existing side valve, we would be happy to provide you with a cost estimate for new interconnect facilities. The line pressure at the side valve would be near psig.\n\nIf they are instead interested in going to Duke, their line pressure is also near psig.

The initial deliveries are currently going into the ANR system as it is the only interconnect that is ready at the moment. Alliance has been experiencing some delays but deliveries are starting to ramp up after months of speculation in the industry. Full commercial service will be delayed nearly a month until October, when construction of the system was scheduled nearly three years ago. However, this delay does not mean that the market won't be getting any Canadian gas from Alliance until the end of October. The pipeline opened one of its Chicago delivery valves last Thursday and started selling MMcfD of gas into the market, with plans to increase sales each week eventually reaching its full BCfd load prior to switching to commercial service in October. Spokesman Jack Crawford stated that they have received commission approval to sell their test gas now, and are dealing with three or four different marketers. Over the next few weeks, they expect all connections to be ready and tested. Crawford also mentioned that it is unusual for there to be regular volume increases of MMcfD each week but that seems to be the game plan."

Handling situations that have occurred multiple times this week where TRW has lost compression: We will address these situations on a case-by-case basis and work towards finding solutions to prevent recurrences.\n\n6. Making up for under deliveries during the rest of the month if you cannot accept payback when an under delivery occurs: If we cannot accept payback, we will make up for the under delivery in subsequent days or weeks.\n\n7. Determining responsible party and excluding associated volume from penalty when caused by Transwestern: We will determine responsibility and adjust volumes accordingly based on our agreed-upon procedures.\n\n8.

Here are some highlights: \n\n- The higher rate of economic growth is expected to lead to a greater expansion in natural gas use than previously forecast over the next years, up from TCF to TCF.\n- Projected prices have also increased from $ to $\n- US economic growth is projected at an average rate of % per year over the next years, up from its previous estimate of %. This economic growth will boost overall energy demand from Quads to Quads.\n- The increase in the projection for natural gas demand by slightly over TCF (loosely equal to Quads) accounts for about half the change in energy projections. \n\n- Gas prices are expected to decline within two years from current highs, but long-term technology improvements in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are expected to moderate price increases even as demand for these fuels grows.\n\n- The report also projects world oil prices will reach $ in the longer term, up just slightly from the $ last year's forecast.\n- There will be a higher annual increase in power demand over the next years compared to the previous prediction. However, prices are expected to decline less than predicted, due to the higher projected gas prices. Instead of cents per kWh, electric rates are expected to hold at cents per kWh.\n\n- Power to be provided by nuclear generation has jumped from the forecast last year due to lower estimated costs for extending the life of current nuclear plants and higher projected natural gas prices. However, total nuclear generation still declines as some existing plants retire.\n\n- Coal will still be the primary fuel for power generation, but its share will dwindle from % to % of the generating total."

As mentioned, any major expansion projects require at least one month to complete after a defined scope of work is established from Planning.\n2. Given that Kevin needs to fly the routes and assess terrain conditions in September, along with Ron running hydraulics on various options, the earliest a Level B estimate can be completed is also September.\n\nRegarding binding contracts for customers:\n1.

However, since transportation rates are still dependent upon a deeper project cost analysis, it's not feasible to comfortably send out binding contracts at this time.\n\nNorm has provided the pipeline lengths for each segment discussed:\n1.

The proposed project aims to tap into the Powder River Basin's rapidly growing gas production which is estimated to hold between 1 TCF and 3 TCF of gas. This development has attracted considerable attention from the industry, with numerous proposed pipelines aiming to reach the Midcontinent Gas Grid. \n\nThe Bison Pipeline, as part of the Northern Border project, would provide a new route out of the Powder River Basin for between 1 and 5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of production starting in November. The pipeline is currently holding an open season on this proposal through December. \n\nReceipt points are proposed with Bighorn, Fort Union Gas Gathering, MIGC, and Thunder Creek Gas Services. A bidirectional interconnect accessing Williston Basin Interstate pipelines, Baker Storage Field, also is proposed. The connection with Northern Border will provide Powder River producers with direct access to several Local Distribution Companies such as Montana-Dakota, Alliant Energy, Interstate Power MidAmerican Energy, Nicor Gas, People Gas, and Nipsco. Additionally, it provides access to ANR Pipeline, Midwestern NGPL, Northern, and Vector. \n\nThe projected resource rate is $0.03/Dth but a negotiated demand rate cuts $0.02 off that. The pipeline is offering mileage-sensitive rates which are expected to allow a shipper to tailor supply access and optimize transportation value. \n\nFor more information, please contact Project Director Paul Miller in Omaha, NE at [Phone_Number_1] or James Hoff in Denver, CO at [Phone_Number_2] or visit the pipeline's website at [Website].

The commission claims that during the open season last February, El Paso Merchant had secretly negotiated a two-cents per MMBTU transportation discount rate on the Mojave Pipeline for service from Topock to Southern California Gas at Wheeler Ridge. This discount was critical as FERC previously ruled that about half of the BCFD El Paso capacity could not directly access the Socal-Topock delivery point. The CPUC argues that this unfair advantage given to El Paso Merchant violated sections 3 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act.

We will have to navigate the legal and regulatory issues surrounding this deal structure as well as the requisite credit assurances with respect to the former.\n\nGeorge Briden of Snake Hill Energy, the project's consultant, suggested a meeting with Transwestern sometime during the week of July. He proposed either Omaha or Houston for the meeting. George would like Drew Fossum to be present, and I think it might be easier to have the meeting here in Houston given our immediate access to maps and engineering data regarding the lateral pipeline.\n\nI suggest we hold the meeting in Houston this week if your schedule permits. Could you please let me know what days you have open that week and if there's an opportunity for you to hop on a plane for either one or both legs of the trip down here? I will also ask Ron Matthews and maybe one or two others to join us so we can cover a broad base of functions in one sitting.\n\nLet me know your thoughts. Others on the distribution, please stay tuned as we gather more information about this meeting date and time.\n\nThanks,\n[Your Name]"

It was indeed a great fun event, and I appreciate the efforts of Lisa Sawyer, Rod Hayslett, Colleen Raker, Brad Holmes, John Millar, John Keller, Marcello Minotti, and Pam Daily who made us proud.

   }, This passage discusses a tragic gas pipeline explosion near Carlsbad, New Mexico, which resulted in multiple fatalities and injuries. The company responsible for the pipeline, El Paso Natural Gas, has expressed condolences to the families affected and is cooperating with investigations to determine the cause of the accident.

The incident has raised concerns about pipeline safety and may lead to stricter regulations in Congress. Senators have been advocating for a Pipeline Safety Improvement Act that would give states inspection and oversight authority over interstate pipelines, create stiffer penalties for pipeline safety transgressors, and offer protection to whistleblowers who report violations.

El Paso Natural Gas has had previous safety violations and was issued a warning letter by the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) in June. However, it is unclear whether this incident will have an immediate impact on pending pipeline safety legislation or regulations.

The explosion has also affected local communities, with the mayor of Carlsbad expressing a desire to prevent similar accidents from happening again. The company is working with families affected by the accident to provide them with support and assistance., {
