      "body": "Dear Ramona,\n\nThank you for your email regarding the cash for fuel issues. I appreciate your thoroughness in outlining the open issues and questions that came up during our meeting last week.\n\n1. Regarding contract specific language on firm contracts to prevent the firm shipper from releasing this fuel discount cash option to an acquiring shipper, we will look into drafting such a clause. However, we need to ensure it is legally sound and aligns with our current contract structure.\n\n2. Building a process to track this fuel option from the firm shipper to the releasing shipper will require additional system modifications. We will discuss the feasibility and potential timeline in our next meeting.\n\n3. For shipper nomination, we can consider defaulting overrun transactions to calculate the fuel in kind using our existing tariff fuel. This would simplify the reconciliation process as suggested. However, this is subject to further discussion and assessment of its impact on our current system.\n\n4. The tariff provision states that the shipper may use the cash for fuel option only if the posted point of sale is a receipt point on their service agreement. This applies to all receipt points, not just the primary ones.\n\nI appreciate your initiative in bringing these matters to our attention and I am more than happy to set up another meeting to further discuss these issues. Please suggest a suitable date and time for you.\n\nBest Regards,\n[Your Name]"

Monitoring PGE's filings for the Gas Accord II filing is recommended, as it was expected to be filed by this point in time. The withdrawal suggests that maintaining the plan rollout for this open season and keeping pace with Ruby and Sonoran pipelines has become impossible. Additionally, there was a growing consensus among market participants that more information concerning backbone rates and operational structure were required. These items would have been included in the long-awaited Gas Accord II filing. It is expected that PGE will likely reapply for an Open Season once the Gas Accord II has been filed.

    "body": "The email discusses several ongoing projects and agreements. Here are some key points:

1. FERC accepted TWS new tariff filing for purchasing capacity on PNMs Blanco to Rio Puerco line, with the condition that TWS can only acquire this offsystem capacity during the APROCT period. They need to file a report at the end of the year detailing any market impact.
2. El Paso Blanco Mismeasurement: El Paso called this week and agreed with TWS that they had been erroneously calibrating their Blanco meter for several years, owing TWS gas volume. They plan to offset this balance against volume NNG owes El Paso Market Services.
3. Arizona Public Service (APS): APS has renegotiated their FT Agreement before the ROFR being triggered at the end of September. APS will renew its MMBTUD Permian to Needles agreement at the max rate for one year, as well as a provision that if they release the capacity at greater than max rate, TWS and APS will share the upside.
4. Red Cedar Gathering: They have received a signed letter agreement from Red Cedar committing to full reimbursement of the capital expense necessary to increase the Arkansas Loop meter from MMBTU to MMBTUD. This meter increase is expected to be completed and flowing in excess of the current MMBTUD by January.
5. System Expansions: They have updated their cost estimates and RAROC for expansions of the IB Link Blanco to Thoreau and mainline segments of the pipe. They will follow up with PNM today on cost comparisons, suggesting that TWS expansion seems more cost-effective than PNMs.
6. BP AMOCOVASTAR Merger: The merger is set for completion today, after which Amoco will begin marketing Vastars equity gas. Amoco has expressed a high level of interest in the remaining capacity from Ignacio to Blanco and from Red Cedar to Blanco, offering a firm offer to TWS next week.
7. September Allocation: Due to compressor failure in TWs West of Thoreau area, MMBTU of volumes were allowed to flow from PGE Topock to Socal Needles. The revenue generated at max rate partially offset the commodity and fuel loss.
8. EOG Resources: EOG Resources executed the interconnect and operating agreement for the expected MMBTUD from their new well. Transwestern has initiated landowner notifications, a process that takes at least 3 days.
9. Becoming a New Shipper: They continue to negotiate with EOG on becoming a new shipper and taking firm transport on TW.
10. Burlington Resources Val Verde Plant: TWS ability to accept the contracted volume from the plant on a consistent basis continues to be an issue due to high temperatures and volume flow in the San Juan region. BR is requesting relief to offset the monetary impact of gas that was shut in or sold at lesser margins in other locations. They are working with Facility Planning to determine what capital equipment may be necessary to meet their contractual demand."

   }, In summary, the current market trends indicate increased gas demand for power generation in California due to declining hydroelectric output and rising power loads. This increase will impact the prices at Malin Hub (Malin-Henry Hub differential) as well as regional supply and demand dynamics within the Rockies and Western Canada. The Rocky Mountains are experiencing an increase in supplies, which is putting downward pressure on local prices by limiting external market access. On the other hand, demand for gas in the Pacific Northwest remains low during late spring and early summer due to declines in heating loads and strong hydroelectric output. However, this situation will change as the heating season begins in late fall and regional demand in the Rockies and Western Canada starts to build up.

In the Southwest, demand is expected to increase from June levels (bcf per day) to August levels (bcf per day), with the Texas market determining the relative strength of differentials in the San Juan Basin and Permian Basins. The San Juan Basin has narrowed its differential from an early July level of $1.05/MMBtu to less than $0.50/MMBtu, while the Permian Basin is pricing at a slight premium to the Henry Hub price.

The rapid build in supply in the Rockies will likely keep differentials wide this year, with an average annual differential below the Henry Hub of approximately $1.00/MMBtu expected. The first likely expansion of export pipelines is Trailblazer, and differentials are expected to remain wide until these expansions take effect. It's recommended to refer to the provided PDF version for associated tables and further details about these trends.,1. Wigas has increased its IT load by approximately 10,000 MCF/day and requested a pressure increase at the station from 750 to 850 psia. A form pressure increase request form is being circulated for signature with a targeted Nov inservice date.

2. The Monroe TBS Mods project was released to engineering, resulting from Wigas' increased IT load and pressure increase request. The project consists of replacing both meters with spool pieces and performing a pressure test to upgrade the MAOP.

3. The Melbourne TBS Mods project was also released to engineering, aiming to support an increase in firm from 50,000 MCF/day to 100,000 MCF/day at Melbourne. The Marshaltown BL is currently constrained and cannot accommodate the incremental firm.

4. The Adel TBS Mods project was released to engineering due to a customer's request to convert an existing IT load at Adel to a firm load, with the new firm load being 50,000 MCF/day. The project has a targeted Nov inservice date and will involve installing a new meter along with piping size modifications.

5. Research was conducted for marketing regarding the possibility of injecting ethanol into the pipeline for a potential green energy rating and Btu enhancement. However, it was recommended that this project not be pursued due to various issues such as liquids entering fuel systems and high costs.

6. A request was received from the optimization team to review the capacity of the mole sieve dehy system at Beaver Compressor Station on the SE line. Beaver is considering a capital project to reroute the dehy system that is currently piped into the suction of the station to the discharge, increasing its capacity.

7. Three detailed cost estimates for the Cogentrix Power Plant proposals were prepared and forwarded to marketing. The details of the cost estimate included a breakdown of costs such as material costs, labor, freight, taxes, surveys, permits, construction support, district labor, engineering, drafting, as-builts, contingency, overhead, and AFFDc.

8. Seven sites were examined for a proposed ethanol plant in Cherokee County, Iowa, with a delivery volume of 2 MMCFD at a delivery pressure of 1050 psia. It was assumed that the initial load would be 1 MMCFD for two years and then increase to 2 MMCFD level. The cost estimate assumed an initial design for 1 MMCFD, reducing costs for the project. Each cost estimate was done for a firm transport level and an interruptible transport level. Two of the sites are on the C line approximately 30 miles southwest of the Paullina station, while the remaining sites were on the Storm Lakelytton branchline., {

       "body": "Dear Recipient,\n\nIt appears that you have received an email regarding the high speed regulation in California and the ongoing energy market crisis. The pace of regulatory and political events in California has indeed reached a feverish pitch, with important decisions being made quickly at the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the state legislature.\n\nThe increasing uncertainty most market participants perceive is due to sudden changes in the market structure that used to require years in complex regulatory and legislative proceedings. This has been exacerbated by rolling blackouts in urban centers of northern California, including San Francisco, Sacramento, and the Silicon Valley.\n\nThe state officials are scrambling to set up the appropriate credit mechanisms to ensure the continued delivery of scarce western energy supplies to the two largest utilities (Pacific Gas and Electric (PGE) and Southern California Edison (SCE)).\n\nThe California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) has been unable to secure enough power to keep the lights on. Meanwhile, legal actions by some energy suppliers threaten to tip the utilities into bankruptcy.\n\nHere's a summary of the various state actions being pursued:\n1. The California Governor is attempting to act on behalf of PGE and SCE to secure long-term contracts for supply from merchant generation owners and marketers in California.\n2. The governor is negotiating with generators to keep them from seeking compensation through the courts for energy delivered to the utilities.\n3. Court-ordered reimbursement could prompt bankruptcy for the utilities.\n4. Legislature bills have been approved to authorize continued power purchases on behalf of PGE and SCE by the CDWR.\n5. The independent system ISO governing board is being restructured to consist of five members appointed by the governor.\n6. The ability of the ISO to enter into a broader interstate regional transmission organization RTO without explicit approval of the electricity oversight board has been restricted.\n7. The divestiture of the investor-owned remaining generating assets is prohibited until a vehicle for pursuing state bond financing for acquisition of transmission assets and construction of new generation facilities is developed.\n\nOn January, the CPUC adopted a decision prohibiting the sale of Mohave Generating Station to AES. This voids a sale that was announced but not closed. The CPUC also delayed decisions regarding application to end its rate freeze and the prudency criteria for utilities entering into long-term supply contracts.\n\nSome of these issues will continue to evolve as they progress along their respective and sometimes intersecting paths, and some will need to pass through multiple review bodies. This rapid and erratic evolution has not helped to decrease either the financial risk associated with supplying energy to the two largest utilities or the level of uncertainty in developing new generation to supply California in the future.\n\nThe ISO anticipates that it will call stage emergencies reserves less than 1% for January, and will most likely continue to curtail interruptible customers through the weekend. Western energy supplies are being strained by recent heavy usage of hydroelectric facilities where water supplies are already as much as 50% below average owing to low precipitation and continued plant outages near mw in California.\n\nThe gravity of the financial condition of the two largest utilities is exemplified by the need for other more creditworthy intermediaries, including California municipal utilities, state agencies, and some unregulated energy suppliers, to act as temporary guarantors for the acquisition of energy on behalf of PGE and SCE.\n\nFor more information and to register, please visit our website.

There is no discount letter associated with this contract.\n\nHowever, I am circulating this for approval because it contains a special provision found in the other section regarding marketing of capacity for release as allowed by section of Transwestern's tariff. Christine and Michelle will need to fill in the address and account information.\n\nI apologize for operating outside the usual contracting procedure, but given the urgency of the situation, I felt it was best to get a pro forma version of this out for approval as soon as possible. Please email your approval to Christine and me by noon tomorrow if possible.\n\nThank you,\nMary Kay Miller"

       "body": "Dear [Recipient],\n\nI am writing to update you on some significant developments regarding our contracts with Aquila USGT and Astra Power LLC, as well as the anticipated closing of the Public Service of New Mexico contract. We successfully negotiated an extension of the MMBTUD East-to-East contract with Aquila USGT this week, with improved economics for their existing contract. The extension begins in November, featuring a reservation rate and a sharing of the Permian to California border index spreads on all alternate westward flow.\n\nFor their existing contract, we negotiated a rate effective from February through October on the alternate west flow, representing an improvement. Additionally, we negotiated a similar east deal with alternate west flow for Astra Power LLC. Their reservation rate is on a volume of [specific volume], for a term of March through March.\n\nWith the execution of these two deals and the expected closing of the Public Service of New Mexico contract, we will effectively sell out the east end of the TW system through at least San Juan flow conditioner. The decision was made this week to postpone until March the application of the ExxonMobil flow conditioner in the San Juan Lateral.\n\nHad we proceeded with the application in February, a tariff month, the minimum lost revenue impact for one day could have been Southwest Gas. We received the fully executed OBA contract from Southwest Gas this week.\n\nGas inventory is moderating with temperatures out west reducing demand and shippers paying gas back to TW. We experienced high linepack for most of the week, allowing us to sell MMBtu at the border for a net revenue of [specific amount].\n\nWe negotiated a San Juan pool contract for MMBTUD at max rates for February. Reliant is flowing alternate out of path from San Juan to the border and scheduling incremental revenue for this could range from [minimum potential revenue] to [maximum potential revenue] for the month.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"

    "body": "Dear Employee,\n\nThis email introduces your first SAP Paycheck. This is the first payroll processed in SAP for all employees paid out of corporate payroll. You may notice some changes in the way information is reflected on your Pay Advice:\n\n1. Your cost center will be displayed at the top of the Pay Advice. This is your department number as designated in the HR and Financial modules of SAP.\n\n2. Earnings descriptions that start with a '*' represent earning types reported in the prior period for instance if you reported vacation time for the July pay period, it will be reflected on your July Pay Advice as 'Flex Dollars' will appear on the Earnings section of the Pay Advice instead of as a credit in the Deduction section.\n\n3. The various benefit deductions will remain itemized in the Deduction section.\n\n4. If you transfer between companies during the year, your totals will carry forward to the new company Pay Advice. Previously, Year-to-Date totals started over when transferred to another company. This change will provide your total earnings and deduction amounts on your Pay Advice throughout the year.\n\n5. Note that at the end of the year, your earnings by company for salaried employees will be reflected separately.\n\n6. Any reported exception time eg vacation sick day etc will be reflected on the Earnings section with hours only. The related dollar amount will be included in the Earnings type.\n\n7. For any other information or further explanations regarding your Payroll, contact the Payroll Call Center at payroll@yourcompany.com.\n\n8. 'What does Lines stand for' in my Paycheck? There is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the Paycheck for some employees. The number of deductions are more than we have room to print in this circumstance. The system totals all remaining deductions and prints them on one line titled 'The Detail of all Deductions' can be viewed on the Pay Advice that is displayed on the intranet at eHrOnline.com.\n\n9. What do the Earnings or Deduction Codes on my Paycheck mean? These definitions are listed on the Payroll webpage located at hrweb.com. Select 'Payroll' from the side index.\n\n10. Why is my Overtime not reflected on my Paycheck? Overtime is paid one pay period in arrears therefore it will be reflected in the next Pay Advice for example if you reported overtime for the July Pay Period, it will be reflected on your July Pay Advice as 'What is the limit for Social Security FICA for the year?' The limit is based on a wage base. This limit is applied to each payroll tax company therefore if you transfer to another company these limits will start over however the total amount withheld across all companies will be reflected on your Paystub.\n\n11. Excess FICA will be credited to you by the IRS via your Tax Return.\n\n12. What federal income tax rate is used for my Bonus or when I exercise Stock Options? There is a standard federal income tax rate of 25% for these earnings. This can be higher if the employee has completed a supplemental tax form requesting a higher rate. This form can be found at hrweb.com select 'Payroll' from the side index."

        "body": "The email discusses the recent surge in gas prices in California, particularly focusing on Southern California. The cause of this dramatic escalation is attributed to scarcity of gas due to several factors such as heavier-than-normal heating loads due to uncommonly cold temperatures, planned and unplanned nuclear plant outages, depletion of storage in Southern California, transmission constraints on regional pipelines, and growing demand from competing markets in the desert southwest and northern California. The email also mentions that most of the gas supply comes from out-of-state sources, with only a small percentage coming from in-state producers.

However, only a fraction of this, about MW, represented new plants. \n- Gas-fired power accounted for the largest share of non-utility generation last year, and the Pacific Census Division accounted for approximately % of that gas-fired capacity. California was the dominant state in the division, with MW of gas-fired only generation and representing MW of total non-utility capacity. \n\nTo access the full report, please visit the EIA's web site at [EIA's web site link]."

    "body": "Dear Lorraine, \n\nThank you for your email regarding the discussion on Red Rock and future expansions during our meeting yesterday. In response to your query about the current capacity through the station in MMBTUD when the San Juan lateral goes partially or totally down, and if Socal can nominate its MMBTU of EOT receipts given our contractual obligations pathed through the station and Red Rock's capacity, I would like to clarify a few points:\n\n1. When the San Juan lateral is unavailable, the lower pressure at the junction may indeed allow for an increase in the transported volume from EOT (Excess of Transport) to MMBTUD. However, this depends on several factors such as the current demand and availability of resources.\n\n2. Regarding Socal's ability to nominate its MMBTU of EOT receipts during this situation, it is important to note that our contractual obligations may vary in such cases. It would be best to consult the specific clauses in our agreement for a definitive answer.\n\n3. In terms of Red Rock's capacity, I must emphasize that we need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the facilities during any changes or incidents affecting the network. Adjusting the capacity without proper assessment may compromise the overall system integrity.\n\nI hope this provides some clarity on your question, Lorraine. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.\n\nBest regards,\nSteven Faucheaux"
