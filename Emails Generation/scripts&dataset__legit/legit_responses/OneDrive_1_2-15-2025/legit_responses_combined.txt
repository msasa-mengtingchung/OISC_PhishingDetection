{"datasets":[ { "body": "Dear Ramona, Thank you for your email regarding the cash for fuel issues. I appreciate your thoroughness in outlining the open issues and questions that came up during our meeting last week. 1. Regarding contract specific language on firm contracts to prevent the firm shipper from releasing this fuel discount cash option to an acquiring shipper, we will look into drafting such a clause. However, we need to ensure it is legally sound and aligns with our current contract structure. 2. Building a process to track this fuel option from the firm shipper to the releasing shipper will require additional system modifications. We will discuss the feasibility and potential timeline in our next meeting. 3. For shipper nomination, we can consider defaulting overrun transactions to calculate the fuel in kind using our existing tariff fuel. This would simplify the reconciliation process as suggested. However, this is subject to further discussion and assessment of its impact on our current system. 4. The tariff provision states that the shipper may use the cash for fuel option only if the posted point of sale is a receipt point on their service agreement. This applies to all receipt points, not just the primary ones. I appreciate your initiative in bringing these matters to our attention and I am more than happy to set up another meeting to further discuss these issues. Please suggest a suitable date and time for you. Best Regards, " }, { "body": "Thank you for sharing the recap of the first emeeting organized by John Keller's GPG Engineering Construction Group.

FERC accepted TWS new tariff filing for purchasing capacity on PNMs Blanco to Rio Puerco line, with the condition that TWS can only acquire this offsystem capacity during the APROCT period. They need to file a report at the end of the year detailing any market impact. 2. El Paso Blanco Mismeasurement: El Paso called this week and agreed with TWS that they had been erroneously calibrating their Blanco meter for several years, owing TWS gas volume. They plan to offset this balance against volume NNG owes El Paso Market Services. 3. Arizona Public Service (APS): APS has renegotiated their FT Agreement before the ROFR being triggered at the end of September. APS will renew its MMBTUD Permian to Needles agreement at the max rate for one year, as well as a provision that if they release the capacity at greater than max rate, TWS and APS will share the upside. 4. Red Cedar Gathering: They have received a signed letter agreement from Red Cedar committing to full reimbursement of the capital expense necessary to increase the Arkansas Loop meter from MMBTU to MMBTUD. This meter increase is expected to be completed and flowing in excess of the current MMBTUD by January. 5. System Expansions: They have updated their cost estimates and RAROC for expansions of the IB Link Blanco to Thoreau and mainline segments of the pipe. They will follow up with PNM today on cost comparisons, suggesting that TWS expansion seems more cost-effective than PNMs. 6. BP AMOCOVASTAR Merger: The merger is set for completion today, after which Amoco will begin marketing Vastars equity gas. Amoco has expressed a high level of interest in the remaining capacity from Ignacio to Blanco and from Red Cedar to Blanco, offering a firm offer to TWS next week. 7. September Allocation: Due to compressor failure in TWs West of Thoreau area, MMBTU of volumes were allowed to flow from PGE Topock to Socal Needles. The revenue generated at max rate partially offset the commodity and fuel loss. 8. EOG Resources: EOG Resources executed the interconnect and operating agreement for the expected MMBTUD from their new well. Transwestern has initiated landowner notifications, a process that takes at least 3 days. 9. Becoming a New Shipper: They continue to negotiate with EOG on becoming a new shipper and taking firm transport on TW. 10. Burlington Resources Val Verde Plant: TWS ability to accept the contracted volume from the plant on a consistent basis continues to be an issue due to high temperatures and volume flow in the San Juan region. BR is requesting relief to offset the monetary impact of gas that was shut in or sold at lesser margins in other locations.

This increase will impact the prices at Malin Hub (Malin-Henry Hub differential) as well as regional supply and demand dynamics within the Rockies and Western Canada. The Rocky Mountains are experiencing an increase in supplies, which is putting downward pressure on local prices by limiting external market access. On the other hand, demand for gas in the Pacific Northwest remains low during late spring and early summer due to declines in heating loads and strong hydroelectric output. However, this situation will change as the heating season begins in late fall and regional demand in the Rockies and Western Canada starts to build up. In the Southwest, demand is expected to increase from June levels (bcf per day) to August levels (bcf per day), with the Texas market determining the relative strength of differentials in the San Juan Basin and Permian Basins. The San Juan Basin has narrowed its differential from an early July level of $1.05/MMBtu to less than $0.50/MMBtu, while the Permian Basin is pricing at a slight premium to the Henry Hub price. The rapid build in supply in the Rockies will likely keep differentials wide this year, with an average annual differential below the Henry Hub of approximately $1.00/MMBtu expected. The first likely expansion of export pipelines is Trailblazer, and differentials are expected to remain wide until these expansions take effect. It's recommended to refer to the provided PDF version for associated tables and further details about these trends.,1. Wigas has increased its IT load by approximately 10,000 MCF/day and requested a pressure increase at the station from 750 to 850 psia. A form pressure increase request form is being circulated for signature with a targeted Nov inservice date. 2. The Monroe TBS Mods project was released to engineering, resulting from Wigas' increased IT load and pressure increase request. The project consists of replacing both meters with spool pieces and performing a pressure test to upgrade the MAOP. 3. The Melbourne TBS Mods project was also released to engineering, aiming to support an increase in firm from 50,000 MCF/day to 100,000 MCF/day at Melbourne. The Marshaltown BL is currently constrained and cannot accommodate the incremental firm. 4. The Adel TBS Mods project was released to engineering due to a customer's request to convert an existing IT load at Adel to a firm load, with the new firm load being 50,000 MCF/day. The project has a targeted Nov inservice date and will involve installing a new meter along with piping size modifications. 5. Research was conducted for marketing regarding the possibility of injecting ethanol into the pipeline for a potential green energy rating and Btu enhancement. However, it was recommended that this project not be pursued due to various issues such as liquids entering fuel systems and high costs. 6. A request was received from the optimization team to review the capacity of the mole sieve dehy system at Beaver Compressor Station on the SE line. Beaver is considering a capital project to reroute the dehy system that is currently piped into the suction of the station to the discharge, increasing its capacity. 7. Three detailed cost estimates for the Cogentrix Power Plant proposals were prepared and forwarded to marketing. The details of the cost estimate included a breakdown of costs such as material costs, labor, freight, taxes, surveys, permits, construction support, district labor, engineering, drafting, as-builts, contingency, overhead, and AFFDc. 8. Seven sites were examined for a proposed ethanol plant in Cherokee County, Iowa, with a delivery volume of 2 MMCFD at a delivery pressure of 1050 psia. It was assumed that the initial load would be 1 MMCFD for two years and then increase to 2 MMCFD level. The cost estimate assumed an initial design for 1 MMCFD, reducing costs for the project. Each cost estimate was done for a firm transport level and an interruptible transport level. Two of the sites are on the C line approximately 30 miles southwest of the Paullina station, while the remaining sites were on the Storm Lakelytton branchline."}, { "body": "Dear Team, With the holidays quickly approaching, our transportation services will be hosting a food and toy drive from Monday, October through Friday, November.

Best regards, " }, { "body": "Dear Recipient, It appears that you have received an email regarding the high speed regulation in California and the ongoing energy market crisis. The pace of regulatory and political events in California has indeed reached a feverish pitch, with important decisions being made quickly at the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the state legislature. The increasing uncertainty most market participants perceive is due to sudden changes in the market structure that used to require years in complex regulatory and legislative proceedings. This has been exacerbated by rolling blackouts in urban centers of northern California, including San Francisco, Sacramento, and the Silicon Valley. The state officials are scrambling to set up the appropriate credit mechanisms to ensure the continued delivery of scarce western energy supplies to the two largest utilities (Pacific Gas and Electric (PGE) and Southern California Edison (SCE)). The California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) has been unable to secure enough power to keep the lights on. Meanwhile, legal actions by some energy suppliers threaten to tip the utilities into bankruptcy. Here's a summary of the various state actions being pursued: 1. The California Governor is attempting to act on behalf of PGE and SCE to secure long-term contracts for supply from merchant generation owners and marketers in California. 2. The governor is negotiating with generators to keep them from seeking compensation through the courts for energy delivered to the utilities. 3. Court-ordered reimbursement could prompt bankruptcy for the utilities. 4. Legislature bills have been approved to authorize continued power purchases on behalf of PGE and SCE by the CDWR. 5. The independent system ISO governing board is being restructured to consist of five members appointed by the governor. 6. The ability of the ISO to enter into a broader interstate regional transmission organization RTO without explicit approval of the electricity oversight board has been restricted. 7. The divestiture of the investor-owned remaining generating assets is prohibited until a vehicle for pursuing state bond financing for acquisition of transmission assets and construction of new generation facilities is developed. On January, the CPUC adopted a decision prohibiting the sale of Mohave Generating Station to AES. This voids a sale that was announced but not closed. The CPUC also delayed decisions regarding application to end its rate freeze and the prudency criteria for utilities entering into long-term supply contracts. Some of these issues will continue to evolve as they progress along their respective and sometimes intersecting paths, and some will need to pass through multiple review bodies. This rapid and erratic evolution has not helped to decrease either the financial risk associated with supplying energy to the two largest utilities or the level of uncertainty in developing new generation to supply California in the future. The ISO anticipates that it will call stage emergencies reserves less than 1% for January, and will most likely continue to curtail interruptible customers through the weekend. Western energy supplies are being strained by recent heavy usage of hydroelectric facilities where water supplies are already as much as 50% below average owing to low precipitation and continued plant outages near mw in California. The gravity of the financial condition of the two largest utilities is exemplified by the need for other more creditworthy intermediaries, including California municipal utilities, state agencies, and some unregulated energy suppliers, to act as temporary guarantors for the acquisition of energy on behalf of PGE and SCE.

Overtime is paid one pay period in arrears therefore it will be reflected in the next Pay Advice for example if you reported overtime for the July Pay Period, it will be reflected on your July Pay Advice as 'What is the limit for Social Security FICA for the year?' The limit is based on a wage base. This limit is applied to each payroll tax company therefore if you transfer to another company these limits will start over however the total amount withheld across all companies will be reflected on your Paystub. 11. Excess FICA will be credited to you by the IRS via your Tax Return. 12. What federal income tax rate is used for my Bonus or when I exercise Stock Options? There is a standard federal income tax rate of 25% for these earnings. This can be higher if the employee has completed a supplemental tax form requesting a higher rate. This form can be found at hrweb.com select 'Payroll' from the side index." }, { "body": "Dear , Thank you for providing the revised draft of the TWS Capacity Option Filing. I appreciate the helpful comments received last week and have incorporated changes addressing rates, limitation of liability, and necessary exceptions to Commission policy as discussed. I noticed that some sections may need expansion or modification based on further review. Also, a section has been included in the tariff cross-referencing applicable general terms and conditions. The letter and tariff sheets are redlined for your convenience, but I did not make significant changes to the agreement. At this stage, I have not determined a projected filing date yet. However, I believe it is crucial to plan our prefiling communication with customers as well as informal discussions with FERC staff. I will reach out to some of you to coordinate these efforts, which should help us decide on a reasonable filing date. Since this filing is still just a draft and may change based on what we hear from customers, I will keep everyone in the loop and leave it up to you to decide when and with whom to meet to gather necessary information.

However, only a fraction of this, about MW, represented new plants. - Gas-fired power accounted for the largest share of non-utility generation last year, and the Pacific Census Division accounted for approximately % of that gas-fired capacity.

OneOk: They might be more flexible with contract terms, given their mid-sized status. However, they may need more time to mobilize resources.

In response to your query about the current capacity through the station in MMBTUD when the San Juan lateral goes partially or totally down, and if Socal can nominate its MMBTU of EOT receipts given our contractual obligations pathed through the station and Red Rock's capacity, I would like to clarify a few points: 1. When the San Juan lateral is unavailable, the lower pressure at the junction may indeed allow for an increase in the transported volume from EOT (Excess of Transport) to MMBTUD. However, this depends on several factors such as the current demand and availability of resources. 2. Regarding Socal's ability to nominate its MMBTU of EOT receipts during this situation, it is important to note that our contractual obligations may vary in such cases. It would be best to consult the specific clauses in our agreement for a definitive answer. 3. In terms of Red Rock's capacity, I must emphasize that we need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the facilities during any changes or incidents affecting the network. Adjusting the capacity without proper assessment may compromise the overall system integrity. I hope this provides some clarity on your question, Lorraine.

If you are receiving gas from both TW and EPNG, and for some reason EPNG shuts off deliveries, we can model the impact of delivering all the plant's requirements for known durations. The contract rate will be a negotiated rate, which eliminates rate risk for Gila. The rate design is currently one-part with no differentiation between reservation and commodity. The rate does not include ACA GRI surcharges or fuel; it covers only a minimal return on the projects capital cost plus ongoing O&M fuel costs. The fuel was set with the shippers in the rate case, and the offer to Panda is consistent with the current tariff. As the term gets shorter, the rate by necessity goes up to cover the return hurdles and delivery pressure at the Panda EPNG interconnect should be a minimum capacity of the lateral from Copper Eagle to EPNG. If an alternative receiver is required, we can discuss our thoughts here: if Panda is willing to commit to taking capacity in the project, then TW would give you all the necessary flexibility to move gas to other destinations at the contract rate for instance, Panda would be paying a one-part rate for delivery to the plant. If for some reason, plant demand was reduced, you would have all the flexibility to move gas to alternative markets. We have to plan for the worst case scenario and assume there is no storage with this in mind. TW will have some flexibility just due to the size of the project pipe and pressure, but this will depend on what other shippers are doing. Again, we are modelling the hydraulics. Looking forward to speaking with you soon. Best, " }, { "body": "Thank you for bringing this important issue to my attention. It appears that the California send out numbers are indeed pushing the envelope, and the collective situation with SOCAL and PG&E withdrawing over BCFD is concerning. As predicted in a gas-short marketplace, this shortage seems to be exacerbated and may worsen in the next few years, especially with the addition of the new EOC power plants. It's crucial to note that the power generated by these plants might primarily serve native markets rather than the CA ISO-PX with its price cap feature.

El Paso has proposed several ways this expansion could be achieved, including adding compression to the proposed line project, replacing or recommissioning existing compression, or adding new compression to its existing system. The preferred method will be determined by a cost analysis and identifying where shippers want the capacity. El Paso has already posted BCFD of California-bound pipeline capacity for sale effective June of this year.

October differentials at Chicago are predicted to be higher due to supply anxiety. The gas market is exposed to a potential supply shortfall late in the winter even under normal weather conditions, which has placed a floor on the gas price at the price of residual fuel oil itself priced in the mid to upper range. Gas prices moving into this range would begin to attract demand back into the market. Diverting supplies from storage and increasing supply concerns again. There is little demand response to price until industrial demand lessens or the price of distillate oil, as of this writing near $2.30 per million British thermal units (mmbtu), is breached. However, distillate markets themselves are extremely tight and prices for that fuel would likely follow gas prices up within this range. Prices are defined mainly by supply and judgment of the likelihood of a supply shortfall, which would be characterized by extreme pricing and volatility and a difficult process of supply allocation by price. By now exposure to extreme price volatility this winter is certain although CERA expects storage injections to increase by approximately 1 Bcf per day from August to September, this increase would still leave inventories at record lows for this month and next even this increase in injections will not occur if a tropical storm forces evacuation of offshore platforms or if hot weather returns for October. Heating load enters the picture with us supplies running close to year-earlier levels.

The technical conference has been scheduled in Washington DC for January. 2. We hedged MMBtud of fuel for the calendar year and unwound it the following day as the market dipped, resulting in a small gain. We anticipate prices to jump again next week due to the oncoming cold snap. 3. Regarding PNMs request for transport proposal, our response left the current rate structure in place but includes two additional tiers of volumetric incentive pricing as their volume increases. Their rates will go down with increased volumes, and we've also added a seasonal IT rate to meet any swing gas demand requirements. 4. Albuquerque Lateral ENA is meeting with IPP plant owners in the Albuquerque region who are interested in alternative sources of gas supply. If they expand the plant from a peaking unit to a combined-cycle unit, there may be potential for a new delivery lateral off TWS mainline. This deal structure could include a volume incentive rate as throughput increases in the lateral. 5. The next step for TWS is to build a rate matrix under several different operating scenarios. Responses are due to ENA by Friday. 6. The Black Mesa Project is still being evaluated. Converting the Black Mesa coal slurry line owned by Northern Border into gas service could increase our capacity to bring San Juan gas to the California border and potentially provide a positive environmental play for Black Mesa and coal slurry, affecting areas like the Grand Canyon. This project is contingent on several factors, including working with Mohave Generating Station majority owner AES to convert the plant to gas and working with the Navajo who could lose a large export market for their coal. ENA has agreed to approach AES on this project in the near future once their negotiations on the Las Vegas power plant are complete. 7. Legal is checking the existing ROW to see if there are limitations on the pipe usage. 8. We are assembling the volume and revenue impact figures of the November train derailment for submission to Burlington's claims adjusters. This will be combined with the total operations costs." }, { "body": "Dear , I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to provide an update on several matters related to our ongoing projects. 1. Deals: We have closed a deal with Arizona Public Service (APS) regarding MMBTUD. The transaction covers April to October, from EOT Topock. Unfortunately, APS was not a bidder in the IOS last week, and we rejected their offer. However, they agreed to an IT Agreement for MMBTUD on the Crawford Lateral. 2. New Shipper: A new shipper on TW will generate additional revenue starting from September. This is an East-to-East deal at plus fuel. 3. Contract Extensions: Duke FT has agreed to extend its contract from Red Cedar to Blanco from January through December. 4. Verbal Agreement: We have a verbal agreement with Red Cedar for a year deal, with final details being negotiated. The volume would range between MMBTUD. 5. Expansion: We will need to spend approximately $ to expand the metering capability of the Arkansas Loop. 6. FT Agreement: Sempra has agreed to an FT Agreement for Ignacio to Blanco for MMBTUD, with a term of Calendar Q. 7. Space Availability: We have approximately MMBTUD of remaining space available. 8. Production Limitation: Burlington Resources claims we are limiting production from their Val Verde plant because TW is unable to fully accept all the nominations of gas under the current operating agreement, resulting in approximately $ in lost revenues. 9. Data Collection: We are pulling together data on exactly which days we have not been able to take BR's gas thus far. BR has rejected our revised wording in the interconnect amendment specifically best efforts and subject to operating conditions on TW. 10. Amendment Negotiation: We will need to revise this further as they do not think our offered alternate receipt point flexibility at Ignacio and alternate delivery point flexibility at El Paso Blanco on their jackrabbit contract is sufficient to agree to amend the interconnect agreement. 11. Discount Suggestion: They have suggested we consider giving them a deeper discount on their San Juan Waha contract term, but this is not acceptable to TW. 12. Evaluation: We are evaluating all options regarding the situation with Southwest Gas who will soon be capable of receiving gas through the new interconnect in Nevada under the terms of the agreement. 13. Tariff Meetings: Tariff meetings were held this week with customers and internal personnel to finalize details of the program. 14. Employment Reviews: Midyear employment reviews were completed for all team members this week. Looking forward to further updates and discussions.

I'll break down the information into digestible points for better understanding: 1. The sale of MMBTUD of daily firm space moving gas from PGE Topock to Socal Needles is underway, given the unique price spreads in California. 2. We are also discussing potential participation in a gas storage field on Navajo land near Farmington NM, where third-party developers require our assistance. 3. The development of Transwestern's hourly firm service has been delayed until power plant loads become operational. During this interim period, Park n Ride services provided intraday will be priced higher than those provided on a timely basis. 4. El Paso El Paso Merchant Services needs to reconsider their verbal offer for a million lump sum prepayment option of fuel monetization for their combined MMBTUD of San Juan to California capacity. The original offer did not consider the different termination dates of the two contracts. 5. A revised proposed lump sum payment offer is expected mid-next week. 6. El Paso Field Services met with EP representatives to discuss a possible interconnect near the IC, sized for MMBTUD. EP proposes to pay for and set compression to flow this gas into our high pressure line, committing to a volume of MMBTUD for up to years. 7. An added advantage is that most of the volume would come from the constrained Atoka area, allowing Agave to increase deliveries to TW. 8. Caithness Corp has decided to move forward on their MW generation project in Northwest Arizona, initially consuming MMBTUD of gas. The proposed location is miles south of TWS line near Wickieup AZ. 9. We are meeting with Caithness Reps next week, and the projected inservice date for the plant is early Cooler Expansion Level B. 10. Cost estimates are being prepared for this project, and revenue cost savings assumptions predict annual revenue to support the expenditure once installed. Once we receive the cost estimate, financial evaluations will be done. I hope this breakdown helps clarify the updates provided in your email.

According to Jeff Dasovich, the CEO of Sempra, he has publicly referred to the project as a 'bypass pipeline'. The pipe is planned to drop down through Imperial irrigation, follow the border on the Mexico side, go through Mexicali, serve the new Sempra LDC there, return across the border to south of San Diego to the PG&E Otay Mesa IPP, and then proceed to Rosarita. As discussed, with the public reference to this project as a bypass pipeline, it seems that future similar projects in California may no longer be under wraps. The significant opposition that could potentially arise for this project might come from the CPUC or other customer groups such as Turn or ORA, who may voice concerns about the project's cherrypicking of gas loads.

We are pleased to inform you that last month's response has been positive. If you have not had a chance to visit the enrollment site, we encourage you to do so as soon as possible. The link to the website is provided at the end of this message. Some users may have experienced problems launching the site or enrolling; we apologize for any inconvenience and suggest that you use Internet Explorer or Netscape for a smoother experience, especially if you are using the Lotus Notes web browser as your default. The original message regarding the PAC is provided below: Last year, the PAC launched a campaign to become a million-dollar PAC, with employees providing all of the funding. The PAC reached its objective and became one of the largest corporate PACs. This year we face new challenges due to the sale of EOG, the announced sale of PG&E, and regular employee turnover. We are seeking your support if you are not a member, please join; if you are a member, we hope you will consider increasing your contribution. The PAC is an essential tool in our effort to promote sound public policy. Our PAC funds support local, state, and federal candidates of both parties who support open markets, deregulation, and customer choice. Contributions may be used to make political contributions in connection with federal and state elections and are subject to the limits of the Federal Election Campaign Act. While our PAC has grown thanks to employee contributions, it still generates just a fraction of the expenditures of those who oppose these ideals. This year we face challenges and opportunities for every one of our businesses, including issues such as taxation, e-commerce industry restructuring, regulation of derivatives, international trade and investment legislation, pipeline safety, local and state decisions affecting the siting and interconnection of power plants, and a variety of environmental and tax issues. The PAC has a long and successful track record of supporting and advancing good public policy; this track record depends on access to and regular communication with decision-makers. The PAC provides that access, showing policy makers that real voters care about what they are doing. The PAC challenges the status quo, asks why things are done a certain way, and helps us change them. We need your help to continue this important work; sign up today or revise your current contribution level by connecting with the PAC intranet com." }, { "body": "Dear Recipient, I am writing to inform you about the Houston Energy Expo, taking place at George R.

Additionally, we are excited to share that AEC has decided to join a group examining the feasibility of the Ruby Pipeline, proposed by Colorado Interstate Gas. The proposed Ruby Line would have a daily capacity of 1 million cubic feet and connect Wyoming to Northern California with a connection to the Wild Goose Storage Facility. The addition of this large new pipeline in the region would provide Wild Goose storage customers with a more liquid trading hub at the heart of the volatile California gas market. Preliminary assessment of this proposed project suggests it offers a very competitive means of delivering additional supply flexibility into California from the growing US Rockies production basin. If you have any questions about the specifics of the opportunities to ship gas on the Ruby Pipeline, please contact Ed Miller at or Tom Dobson at with Colorado Interstate Gas. If you have questions about obtaining capacity at Wild Goose, please call either Ben Ledene with Wild Goose Storage at , Chris Price at , or Mark Baldwin at with Interstate Gas Services.

It's good to hear that despite the ongoing system maintenance, gas control has been able to increase TWS West flow and schedule deliveries at max rates from Topock to Needles. The slight increase will be helpful in making up for the greater decrease in volume due to DOT mandated reduced operating pressures during the safety digouts in early May. The reduction of mMBTUD to the border during that period is expected, but we appreciate the information about the Atoka Lateral test and the collaboration with Agave Petroleum. The reconfiguration of gas flow at the Atoka station should help optimize resources around the system. Regarding the collaboration with Oneok Westar, it's interesting to learn that they are working towards making the existing Ward County TX delivery point a high-volume bidirectional point by installing additional pipe. The ability to flow mMBTUD into TWS high pressure line will certainly free up some compressor capacity for gas flowing to Texas intrastate lines.

Here are the answers to the questions as I understand them: 1. Can TW use negotiated rate agreements for its new MMD expansion? Yes, they can, but they must always offer cost-based recourse rate service as an alternative. 2. Can they give prospective customers a cafeteria-style menu of options? Yes, they can define specific negotiated rate options and stick to them. However, it's important to ensure that they can enforce a 'no substitutions' policy to maintain structure in the negotiated rate approach. 3. How much flexibility do they have in structuring the options? They should have discretion in how to structure their negotiated rate options, but they must be careful not to be second-guessed by FERC as to whether they should have offered a different option instead. 4. Can they slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a better deal than the recourse option for most shippers? It's possible, but they need to be careful not to discriminate against other customers. 5. How do they allocate capacity if demand exceeds supply? Ideally, they would allocate it to the guys who want to buy it in the way they prefer to sell it. However, they must cover the recourse demand first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else. 6. Can they sell to the guys who want option 'Y' years and the remaining to the guys that really choke the recourse bidders? They may need to consider filling the recourse rate guys orders first, and then giving the remaining capacity to the neg rate guys whose bids they value most highly using some objective non-discriminatory calculation. 7. Is it necessary to get MEKM on the phone to discuss these questions? It would be beneficial to discuss these questions with them at your convenience as they might have more specific insights or information." }, { "body": "The email discusses the expected increase in home heating costs this winter due to strong economic growth and high crude oil prices.

Recall process: - Allocation rules: To be determined, perhaps based on current nomination processes if still in place. - Tracking recalled volumes and contracts: A tracking system may need to be developed or existing systems modified. - Monitoring recall process: A designated team member(s) will monitor this process. - Recall notice timing: Ideally, the recall notice should occur before the gas day starts, but partial day recalls and after-gas-day notices may need to be considered. 4. Transporter call volumes tracking system may require updates. 5. System changes for capacity release and invoice system adjustments will likely be necessary. 6.

Storing information at a contract level in CBS or the rate system is to be determined, possibly both depending on the specific data requirements. 9.

They expect regional shortfalls in gas supply due to low storage levels, possibly leading to all-time low levels this winter. According to their report, the U.S. will likely see a gas demand increase by about 4 Bcf/d as new gas-fired electric generation plants come online. However, they forecast that domestic production will only increase by less than 2 Bcf/d by the end of this year, meaning that gas prices must rise to crimp over 1 Bcf/d of demand out of the supply-demand equation. This suggests that gas prices must go higher in the coming years.

I have reviewed everything, and it appears that all the releases and acquisitions look good, including the necessary adjustments you've identified. If I need further assistance, I will reach out to you. Regarding your specific points: 1. The ENA K RES manual rate adjustment is needed for the split of marketing fees for capacity released to Burlington Conoco. 2. The Thoreau to E Thoreau line item in the Conoco K Comm should be deleted. 3. Authorized overrun line items should be removed, and volumes should be rolled up to the commodity charge type 'Texaco K Comm' when verifying fuel rate for the lateral and mainline contract schedules. 4. There seems to be a difference in volumes between the lateral and mainline contracts which could not be attributed to rounding. I need to verify if this difference is caused by makeup volumes, and if delivery makeup is scheduled then the invoice should be adjusted accordingly. 5. Please remember that these points are based on data as of now; I will review again on the schedulers. Lastly, I request a final copy of the Delivery Tolerance Report to both me and Marketing so we can determine if makeup will affect the rate to be charged.

(KMI) plans to contribute $1.35 billion in assets to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (KMP), its master limited partnership. The largest asset being contributed is the Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, formerly Midcon Texas - a natural gas pipeline system extending from South Texas to Houston along the Texas Gulf Coast. Other assets include the Casper and Douglas Gas Gathering and Processing Systems, KMI's interest in Coyote Gas Treating, and KMI's interest in Thunder Creek Gas Services. In return, KMI will receive $1.35 billion in cash and KMP partnership units. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. Rich Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan, stated that this transaction benefits both KMI and KMP as the pipeline assets are a good fit for KMP due to their long-term contracts in place and significant growth opportunities. Because the consideration paid will include equity issued to KMI, there will be no need to raise funds via a public offering of KMP units. KMI will also benefit from the transaction as it will reduce its debt by $1 billion and is expected to be modestly accretive to KMI's earnings per share. Upon closing, KMP will have completed over $2.75 billion in acquisitions in 2021, boosting KMI's total asset contribution to KMP to more than $14 billion - far exceeding the original goal stipulated when Kinder Morgan merged with KN Energy last July." }, { "body": "Thank you for sending the Transwestern Capacity Release Report.

The excavation of approximately feet of pipe, inspection, and replacement of the coating (if necessary), seems like a thorough process. I appreciate the transparency on the timeline for getting the line back in service during the weekend of November. Regarding the temporary reduction of maximum pressure, it's important to keep track of both costs and revenue losses to enable a swift recovery of damages from Burlington and/or business interruption insurance.

Top market-based rates: If Transwestern intends to offer a top service without a corresponding cost-based recourse service, they would need to make a filing that demonstrates a lack of market power comparable to the extent that they implement a top service. 2. Call Put Capability in the Capacity Release Market: It would be highly advisable to provide that other FT holders be able to offer a similar call put capability in the capacity release market. This would likely require specific changes to the capacity release sections in order to allow prospective capacity releases with a call or put pricing option. 3. Manipulation and Market Power: The top service should not be a means for any party, particularly an affiliate, to manipulate the transportation market and/or exert market power by withholding capacity. The top service should require sufficient protections to ensure continued undiminished service to all of Transwestern's existing and future FT customers. 4. Standardization: The terms and conditions for the top service should be standardized in order that each top service offer is not considered a nonconforming contract under FERC policy. The call and put options and any administrative or operating limitations should be specifically defined. 5. Non-Preferential: Transwestern must ensure that the top service is offered and administered in a manner that is fair and equitable and in a manner that does not convey a preferential right to any party, particularly an affiliate. Whether the top is a cost or market-based rate, there will be a question as to where the revenue goes. 6. Pilot Program: Given the precedential nature of this proposal, perhaps the industry would be more comfortable with the top if it were filed as an experimental program on Transwestern with a finite life. This would allow parties to gain experience prior to having all of the pipelines and others file for similar authority. Thanks again for inviting us to lunch yesterday. Both Teddy and I found it to be very helpful and informative. We look forward to a more detailed description of your proposal and the ability to discuss it with Transwestern in a future customer meeting." }, { "body": "Thank you for sending the list and the request to collect Christmas cards.

In brief, Nevada Power Company has agreed to sell the Sunrise Station Electric Generating Plant in Las Vegas, NV to Reliant Energy Power Generation Inc., a subsidiary of Reliant Energy REI. The sale includes two generating units owned by Nevada Power and rights to electricity produced by three additional units on the Sunrise site owned by an independent power producer. The sale price is $80 million (subject to taxes and other adjustments at closing). Concurrently with the purchase, Nevada Power has negotiated the right to buy energy and ancillary services from Reliant Energy Power Generation for agreed upon prices from closing until March, at a cost of $40 million based on the time of closing. This will result in a net price for the generating plant upon closing of approximately $120 million. With the sale of Sunrise Station and the divestiture of our generation assets nearly complete, we will soon be able to devote all our resources to building the best energy transmission and distribution company in the west. Reliant Energy is a leader in power generation and has already established a strong presence in southern Nevada. Sunrise Station consists of two generating units that can be fueled by natural gas or oil, capable of producing up to 800 MW of electricity. The facility also includes three additional gas turbine generating units rated at 300 MW each, owned by an independent power producer, Nevada Sunpeak Limited Partnership under contract to Nevada Power. The sale is expected to close in Q1 20XX (subject to approval and review by various regulatory agencies). The company intends to complete the sale and transfer of all its generating assets in Nevada by this time. Credit Suisse First Boston acted as financial advisor to Sierra Pacific Resources on the Sunrise Station sale, and Navigant Consulting served as the technical advisor. Headquartered in Nevada, Sierra Pacific Resources is a holding company whose principal subsidiaries are Nevada Power Company (the electric utility for southern Nevada), Sierra Pacific Power Company (the electric utility for most of northern Nevada and the Lake Tahoe area of California), and a natural gas and water distributor in the Reno-Sparks area. Other subsidiaries include the Tuscarora Gas Pipeline Company, which owns a percent interest in an interstate natural gas transmission partnership, and Sierra Pacific Communications, a telecommunications company. Reliant Energy and a partner jointly own and operate El Dorado Energy, a natural gas-fired facility southeast of Las Vegas. In October 20XX, Reliant Energy announced plans to construct a natural gas-fired power plant about miles north of Las Vegas off Interstate 15. Based in Houston, Texas, Reliant Energy is an international energy services and energy delivery company with $XX billion in annual revenue and assets totaling $YY billion.

The merger could be terminated after December under the terms of the deal if there had not been satisfactory progress towards completing the transaction.

Both cases are yet to be decided, although PNM has asked the court to either dismiss Western Resources' case or delay action on it until after it has decided its initial suit.

If there's anything in particular that stands out or requires immediate attention, please do let me know." }, {"body": "This text is a summary about the city of Houston, Texas. It highlights three main characteristics of Houston that contribute to its unique identity: 1. Cheap Land and Low Taxes: Houston has maintained an industrial growth model based on cheap land, low taxes, immigrant labor, and unfettered pro-business policies. This model has been successful in attracting businesses and fostering economic development. However, it may not be sustainable in the long term as the city faces challenges related to pollution, quality of life, and education. 2. Diversity: Houston is a multiracial city that has undergone significant demographic changes over the years. It was originally a biracial town with a large black minority, but now its population is roughly one-third white, one-third black, and slightly over one-third brown. This rapid transition from a biracial to a multiracial city has been peaceful and reflects the city's racial tolerance. 3. Civic Mindedness: Houston has a tradition of civic-minded business leaders who are closely tied to the city's fate. One example is Kenneth Lay, former Enron CEO, who has been involved in various city projects. This active involvement of business leaders in city affairs sets Houston apart from other growing cities. The text also mentions some challenges that Houston faces: - Pollution: The city is working to improve its air quality to attract skilled workers. - Sprawl and Zoning: As the city continues to grow outwards, there are concerns about whether it can continue to do so while attracting the skilled people whose jobs are downtown. This may require introducing zoning laws. - Education: Houston's education system is struggling, particularly with regards to graduation rates among Latino students, which is concerning given the increasing importance of education for accessing good jobs in today's economy. Overall, Houston is a city that has undergone significant transformations and is currently thriving due to its unique blend of cheap land, low taxes, immigrant labor, and civic-minded business leaders. However, it faces challenges related to pollution, sprawl, and education that will need to be addressed in the coming years."}, { "body": "Thank you for forwarding the information about the November pricing call and the upcoming monthly calls throughout the winter.

The changes, according to the customers, aim to avoid a more rigorous review and comment process, as they allegedly include provisions that affect imbalance, storage balances, small customer service, gas quality point allocations, curtailment priorities, right of first refusal scheduling priorities, incidental purchase and sale capacity release, unauthorized gas capacity rights, overrun charges, and miscellaneous items. Additionally, the customers are concerned about changes that would give KMIGT discretion in making decisions regarding negative storage imbalances and end of season inventory swaps, as well as changes to the default methodology for point allocations for billing purposes and the injection of KMIGT's discretion into the formula for accepting or rejecting predetermined allocation agreements with upstream or downstream parties. Furthermore, the customers argue that the curtailment provisions filed by KMIGT are contrary to the order mandate and would give the pipeline the opportunity to bottle up significant quantities of coal bed methane gas in Wyoming's Powder River Basin by imposing more rigorous standards on nitrogen content. This could potentially limit downstream pipeline egress out of the Powder River production areas, as six of the seven connecting pipelines identified have no nitrogen specifications, only KMIGT's affiliate Natural Gas Pipeline Co of America has similar rules. The customers also suggest that these changes could create a temporary gap in the downstream movement of coal bed supplies to midcontinent and eastern markets, thereby frustrating consumer access to these significant supplies." }, { "body": "Dear Team, I'm delighted to continue our salute to the ETS employees nominated for the Chairman's Award.

These actions aim to stabilize the market by virtually stripping CalPX and CAISO of their control, allowing for bilateral contracts in the forward market, and scheduling a settlement conference in December for parties involved in California's power market to negotiate these contracts. The FERC order removes the requirement that California utilities buy and sell exclusively through CalPX, clears the way for bilateral contracts, and calls for a benchmark price for wholesale bilateral contracts. It also introduces penalties for underscheduling power loads, market monitoring and price mitigation for the CAISO and CalPX spot markets, and replaces the current CalISO stakeholder governing board with a non-stakeholder board. The FERC's actions have been met with criticism from California utilities such as PGE, who argue that the remedies do not go far enough to ensure electric supply reliability and protect customers from price gouging. They have also requested retroactive price refunds for California customers." }, {"body": "In response to your question, here are some economic factors that could determine where a power plant developer might choose to build a plant and connect it to the grid: 1. Energy Market Structure: The type of market structure (e.g., competitive wholesale markets, regulated monopolies) in the regions where the developer is considering building the plant can impact the profitability of the project. For example, in a competitive market, developers may face lower barriers to entry but also have to compete with other generators for market share. 2. Transmission Access: The ease of accessing the transmission system and the cost of doing so are critical factors. Developers will want to build plants near existing transmission lines or areas where new lines are planned, as this can reduce construction costs and improve the plant's ability to sell its output. 3. Regulatory Environment: State and federal regulations can significantly impact a developer's decision about where to build a plant. For example, stricter environmental regulations may make it more costly or difficult to build plants in some regions. Similarly, policies that promote renewable energy may create opportunities for developers in those areas. 4. Fuel Costs: The cost and availability of fuel are crucial factors in the economic viability of a power plant. Developers will want to build where fuel is abundant and relatively cheap. In the case of natural gas, this might mean building near existing pipelines or areas with shale gas reserves. 5. Load Growth: Developers will also consider the rate of load growth in the regions they are considering. If demand for electricity is growing rapidly, there may be more opportunities to build new plants and sell power. 6. Transmission Congestion: Transmission congestion can impact a developer's ability to sell their output at competitive prices. Developers will want to avoid building plants in areas with high levels of transmission congestion if possible. 7. Incentives/Subsidies: State and federal incentives or subsidies for renewable energy or other types of generation can influence a developer's decision about where to build a plant. For example, a state may offer tax credits or grants for projects that use renewable energy sources. Regarding your question about the Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) rule and why it matters, RTOs are organizations responsible for operating regional electric grids in a manner that ensures reliability, promotes competition, and encourages the efficient use of resources. The development of an effective RTO network can promote efficiency, market transparency, and stimulate competition in the electric industry, ultimately leading to lower costs for consumers. As for whether gas has killed the gas-fired power market, it's a complex issue with multiple factors at play. Gas prices are indeed a critical factor, but they are not the only one. Other factors include policy considerations (e.g., environmental regulations), technological advancements, and changes in consumer behavior. In some cases, gas-fired power plants may no longer be economical due to low natural gas prices or more cost-effective alternatives like renewable energy sources. However, gas will continue to play a role in the electric industry, especially as a flexible resource that can help balance the grid and provide backup power when needed. The future of the gas-fired power market will depend on how these various factors continue to evolve over time. As for your question about building a power plant in New Mexico and connecting it to the grid in California, there are several economic and regulatory factors that would need to be considered. For example, transmission access and costs, fuel transportation costs, state-specific regulations, and market conditions in both states would all play a role in determining the viability of such a project. A thorough analysis would be required to make an informed decision about whether this is a viable option."}, { "body": "Dear Student, It appears that seats are still available in the following courses: Communicating Effectively (October PM), Coaching for Performance (October AM), Noon Motivating for Results (October), Presentations That Work (October PM), and both days for the course (October PM, October).

The California Energy Commission's approval for Calpine to construct the natural gas-fired Metcalf Energy Center in San Jose is indeed significant, especially considering the two-and-a-half year battle against local interests.

The change of heart by the San Jose City Council is a testament to the seriousness of California's energy shortage and the importance of projects like these in power-hungry regions lacking local power sources.

How WFS pays back the old imbalance while also delivering volumes on the new OBA: Payback and deliveries under the new OBA will be scheduled as per our agreed-upon procedures. 3.

Handling situations that have occurred multiple times this week where TRW has lost compression: We will address these situations on a case-by-case basis and work towards finding solutions to prevent recurrences. 6. Making up for under deliveries during the rest of the month if you cannot accept payback when an under delivery occurs: If we cannot accept payback, we will make up for the under delivery in subsequent days or weeks. 7. Determining responsible party and excluding associated volume from penalty when caused by Transwestern: We will determine responsibility and adjust volumes accordingly based on our agreed-upon procedures. 8. What happens when Transwestern accepts intraday nom increases but cannot accept the physical flow needed to rate out the day: In such cases, we will work towards finding a mutually acceptable solution. 9.

For further information, you can visit the provided website. Here are some highlights: - The higher rate of economic growth is expected to lead to a greater expansion in natural gas use than previously forecast over the next years, up from TCF to TCF. - Projected prices have also increased from $ to $ - US economic growth is projected at an average rate of % per year over the next years, up from its previous estimate of %. This economic growth will boost overall energy demand from Quads to Quads. - The increase in the projection for natural gas demand by slightly over TCF (loosely equal to Quads) accounts for about half the change in energy projections. - Gas prices are expected to decline within two years from current highs, but long-term technology improvements in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are expected to moderate price increases even as demand for these fuels grows. - The report also projects world oil prices will reach $ in the longer term, up just slightly from the $ last year's forecast. - There will be a higher annual increase in power demand over the next years compared to the previous prediction. However, prices are expected to decline less than predicted, due to the higher projected gas prices. Instead of cents per kWh, electric rates are expected to hold at cents per kWh. - Power to be provided by nuclear generation has jumped from the forecast last year due to lower estimated costs for extending the life of current nuclear plants and higher projected natural gas prices. However, total nuclear generation still declines as some existing plants retire. - Coal will still be the primary fuel for power generation, but its share will dwindle from % to % of the generating total." }, { "body": "We regret to inform you that there will be an outage on the El Paso line from Eunice Station to Pecos River Station starting at 6:00 AM MDT on Saturday.

A preliminary model has been developed. 2. The final product will not be complete until elevations are verified along the new pipeline route and topographical maps are required to complete this portion of the study. 3. Once these requirements are met, the product will be reviewed by both the Planning Team and System Optimization Team. 4. Studies will be based on the results of the Open Season and the volumes anticipated by Marketing Expansion Facilities will be adjusted accordingly. Regarding the Level B estimates: 1. As mentioned, any major expansion projects require at least one month to complete after a defined scope of work is established from Planning. 2. Given that Kevin needs to fly the routes and assess terrain conditions in September, along with Ron running hydraulics on various options, the earliest a Level B estimate can be completed is also September. Regarding binding contracts for customers: 1. It's important to get the Level B cost estimates put together as soon as possible to send out binding contracts. 2. However, since transportation rates are still dependent upon a deeper project cost analysis, it's not feasible to comfortably send out binding contracts at this time. Norm has provided the pipeline lengths for each segment discussed: 1. Transwestern Mainline Loop Compressor Station to El Paso Take-off Point: miles or say miles 2. New Lateral or A Compressor Station to Phoenix Storage Cavern along I Highway Route: miles or say miles 3. Contingency or Say Miles from El Paso Take-off Point to Phoenix Storage Cavern along El Paso Pipeline Route: 4. Contingency or Say Miles in summary, the new lateral using the El Paso route is miles shorter but will require a mile extension on the Transwestern Loop.

The proposed project aims to tap into the Powder River Basin's rapidly growing gas production which is estimated to hold between 1 TCF and 3 TCF of gas. This development has attracted considerable attention from the industry, with numerous proposed pipelines aiming to reach the Midcontinent Gas Grid. The Bison Pipeline, as part of the Northern Border project, would provide a new route out of the Powder River Basin for between 1 and 5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of production starting in November. The pipeline is currently holding an open season on this proposal through December. Receipt points are proposed with Bighorn, Fort Union Gas Gathering, MIGC, and Thunder Creek Gas Services. A bidirectional interconnect accessing Williston Basin Interstate pipelines, Baker Storage Field, also is proposed. The connection with Northern Border will provide Powder River producers with direct access to several Local Distribution Companies such as Montana-Dakota, Alliant Energy, Interstate Power MidAmerican Energy, Nicor Gas, People Gas, and Nipsco. Additionally, it provides access to ANR Pipeline, Midwestern NGPL, Northern, and Vector. The projected resource rate is $0.03/Dth but a negotiated demand rate cuts $0.02 off that. The pipeline is offering mileage-sensitive rates which are expected to allow a shipper to tailor supply access and optimize transportation value.

The company responsible for the pipeline, El Paso Natural Gas, has expressed condolences to the families affected and is cooperating with investigations to determine the cause of the accident. The incident has raised concerns about pipeline safety and may lead to stricter regulations in Congress. Senators have been advocating for a Pipeline Safety Improvement Act that would give states inspection and oversight authority over interstate pipelines, create stiffer penalties for pipeline safety transgressors, and offer protection to whistleblowers who report violations. El Paso Natural Gas has had previous safety violations and was issued a warning letter by the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) in June. However, it is unclear whether this incident will have an immediate impact on pending pipeline safety legislation or regulations.

Here are some key points from your email: 1. Capacity Marketing PGE Trading has realigned several transport contracts, including a pre-arranged capacity release deal with Texaco for June-October, with Topock delivery capacity at index formula-based rates. 2. However, Texaco is not utilizing Topock and has chosen to re-deliver the gas to Citizens East of the Cal border. 3. Short-term April capacity deals have been arranged with El Paso Field Services (EPFS) to deliver another MMBTUD to TWS West Texas Lateral as early as May, through the new Eddy County NM interconnect. 4. Tw has informed that they will decline to share in the cost of expanding the interconnect at this point. 5. Agave and Duke have regulatory reasons for not taking gas off the LEC and re-delivering it to the Crawford Lateral. 6. Ngpl met with Business Development Reps this week to discuss various interconnects between Ngpl and TWS East system. 7. Ngpl is conducting an open season on expanding the takeaway capacity on their line from the Marathon Indian Basin Plant. 8. To access TWS high pressure system, Ngpl needs to add HP of mainline compression plus a HP booster compressor. 9. The additional horsepower would only bring an estimated MMBTUD incremental to TWS. 10. TW is planning to evaluate the cost of the booster compressor facility and possibly size a larger booster to gain additional throughput capability on the West Texas Lateral. Regarding FERC negotiated rate filings, TW must explain why its actions in offering the negotiated rate contracts were not in contravention of commission policy. They must also provide information about the availability of firm capacity on their system and how they can move gas under the transactions under investigation without interruption. Lastly, Caithness has requested a budget quality cost estimate for tying the power plant exclusively to TW. Caithness will install approximately miles of line to reach TW, with an in-service date for the plant projected as August.

Additionally, you will discuss other general business matters. Your action plan with legal and credit was discussed, and full payment by January latest is expected, effective February with penalty payments for any future imbalance outside the tolerance level. You also mentioned that Pogo Producing plans to spud a well in Eddy County, an offset to the EOG operated well recently completed and being attached to TW. The well will be spud in December with an expected day drill completion time, and production is expected to be close to the EOG well's current initial production of MMCFD. Pogo also plans additional drilling in the field area. Regarding CIG, a conference call was held on Friday to discuss delivery performance issues and the ability of them to increase their delivery capacity to TW at Tumbleweed. It was mentioned that CIG is currently fully subscribed and operating at MAOP along the line which provides deliveries to TW, El Paso NNG, and SPSNichols. They have no operational capability to provide any more incremental delivery capabilities to TW at Tumbleweed currently, but a second Raton expansion project will be announced in March, and looping of this southern line could potentially provide incremental delivery capacity to TW above the current MMCFD level. You also mentioned that you will have additional discussions with CIG marketing individuals to determine who besides El Paso and Evergreen are the primary existing shippers down the southern portion of CIG's system in order to potentially get them to realign their contract to TW as a primary delivery point. You discussed the expediting of the contracting process per Kevin's request, and several ideas were discussed which would streamline and improve the existing contract processing cycle. The most important recommendation was to revise the year-old ETS discounting policy, which Bill Cordes had established for both TW and Northern, in order to simplify the officer approval process and expedite turnaround time." }, { "body": "Dear Team, I am writing to provide an update on recent developments and upcoming discussions. 1. The first true blue California Market Center deal has been completed. MMBTUday was borrowed from PG&E in September and sold to USGT as a ride and park deal at TH. Payback to PG&E has completed as of September. Our monthly roundtable discussion with TH Market Services was held this week, where we gave a brief presentation on the proposed transport options tariff filing and its impact on the TH system. 2. We attended Sempera Energy Trading's weather derivatives briefing chaired by their chief meteorologist Dan Guertin. Dans forecast for the winter of 20XX seems to track with the CPCs forecast. He sees slightly above average temperatures for the western marketplace and a relatively normal winter pattern for the midcontinent. 3. The settlement letter to net out the imbalances between TW, NNG, and El Paso was drafted and sent to El Paso this week for their signature. El Paso has indicated they will respond next week as most of their management is scrambling with the recent reorganization announcement. 4. Burlington Resources Val Verde plant facility planning indicates it will take another HP compressor costing $10 million in order for TW to be able to meet our contractual requirements year-round with Burlington in San Juan. With this uneconomical prospect, we will try and negotiate a yearly average receipt capability versus a daily receipt capability. 5. Burlington reported in Gas Daily this week that their overall production will be down for the third quarter due to processing and treating efficiency problems associated with summer heat in the San Juan Basin and continued mechanical downtime. 6. We had an initial meeting with Koch Midstream Services Company regarding the Coyanosa plant currently connected to Transwestern's most southern area of the West Texas Lateral. Koch does not have equity gas of their own at this plant but has offered to provide us the names of companies who do process gas at the plant. Tailgate gas from the Coyanosa plant is currently sold at the Waha index. Koch's Coyanosa plant is one plant which would potentially provide additional supplies (300 MMcf/d total plant capacity) to Transwestern as part of the Gomez to Puckett tie-in project.

We are open to setting a time for Wednesday afternoon to discuss further. Regarding the MHQ delivery, it appears there should be no problem in delivering it in an hour block as planned. The contract rate will be a negotiated rate, which eliminates rate risk for Gila. The current rate design is one-part with no differentiation between reservation and commodity. The rate does not include AGA GRI surcharges or fuel. It covers a minimal return on the project's capital cost plus the ongoing O&M fuel costs. The offer to Panda is consistent with the current tariff. As the term gets shorter, the rate will inevitably increase to cover the return hurdles and delivery pressure at the Panda EPNG interconnect. We recommend a minimum capacity of the lateral from Copper Eagle to EPNG for delivery. If Panda is willing to commit to taking capacity in the project, we can provide the necessary flexibility to move gas to other destinations at the contract rate. If plant demand was reduced, you would have all the flexibility to move gas to alternative markets. We understand there might be daily imbalances and short-notice start-ups/shuts. We plan for the worst case scenario, assuming there is no storage. However, due to the size of the project pipe and pressure, we will have some flexibility, although this depends on what other shippers are doing. Regarding Southpoint Griffith, I'm not sure about the specific actions taken, but we can follow up with our team for more information. Looking forward to our discussion on Wednesday afternoon.

The Industrial Markets is being created to accelerate the growth of our existing Paper Pulp, Lumber business and to establish and grow a new business in the Steel market. The formation of Industrial Markets will allow North America and Europe management to continue to focus its efforts on the aggressive expansion of our core Gas and Electricity business as a standalone business unit. Industrial Markets will be headed by Jeff McMahon as President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ray Bowen as Chief Operating Officer. They will report to Mark Frevert who will be Chairman of Industrial Markets. Jeff, Ray, and Mark will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Industrial Markets. Included in this new business unit and reporting to the Office of the Chairman will be the following individuals and their respective roles: Pulp, Paper, Lumber Origination - Bryan Burnett; Pulp, Paper, Lumber Trading - Bob Crane; Steel Trading - Greg Hermans; Transaction Development - Rodney Malcolm. Industrial Markets has also established an Operating Group to manage the operations of physical assets. This unit will temporarily report to the Industrial Markets Office of the Chairman. Coincident with the establishment of Industrial Markets, all energy outsourcing activities associated with industries other than Paper Pulp, Lumber, and Steel will be the responsibility of Energy Services. With Jeff's departure from Networks, Louise Kitchen will assume the role of President and Chief Operating Officer. Please join us in congratulating these individuals for their new roles." }, { "body": "Dear Team, I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to share some exciting news regarding our temporary staffing services within the company. A project team, consisting of members such as Laurie Koenig, Carolyn Vigne, Linda Martin, Beverly Stephens, Ena Norma Hasenjager, Peggy McCurley, Jane Ellen Weaver, Paulette Obrecht, George Weber, Eric Merten, Kathy Cook, Carolyn Gilley, Larry Dallman, Corpap, Diane Eckels, and GSS's own Joseph Marsh, Amy Binney, Sharon B Sellers, and Cherri Carbonara, have been researching and evaluating alternative managed services programs. After thorough analysis, we are pleased to announce the beginning of a strategic alliance with Managed Services Group. This group will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web-based online technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. The goal is to make obtaining a temporary worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the best interests of the organization. Phase I of this improvement will be effective from January, encompassing administrative-clerical temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have administrative-clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhancement will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced program. We expect to incorporate the administrative-clerical workers in Omaha, Seattle, and Portland in Phase II which is scheduled for February. Details on how to utilize the Managed Services Program will be announced soon, along with meetings to demonstrate the reporting system and meet the managed services team. I've attached a page detailing the benefits of this new managed services program. I encourage you all to review it at your earliest convenience.

If delivery makeup was scheduled, then the invoice should be adjusted accordingly. 8. A final copy of the delivery tolerance report should be provided to both Elizabeth and Marketing so it can be determined if makeup will affect the rate to be charged. 9. Please note that some contracts are based on calculations especially when charging incremental fees for alternate point usage." }, { "body": "It appears that the email is sharing a humorous and somewhat sarcastic guide to holiday eating.

The production from increased drilling activity is not immediately available as it takes several months for the gas to become usable. The past three winters have been warmer than normal, which may have artificially masked usual consumption patterns under normal weather conditions. This summer's warm weather has caused a significant increase in demand for natural gas in the electricity generation sector, competing with gas storage injections and driving prices upward. US storage inventory levels are currently lower than historical average levels of the past six years, which could eliminate the traditional price advantage of winter heating fuels like propane and heating oil this winter." }, { "body": "Thank you for sending the PDF file about the latest SAP implementation news.

I have revised the paragraph to align with our last posting and included a sentence stating that tie-breakers will be decided by lottery, although I omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time. My only other comment is that I believe the group needs to discuss beforehand how a shipper's request for alternate points will be treated, as currently drafted this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on use of alternate points at the bid rate. This raises questions about our granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount if we do intend to let the winning bidder shipper use alt points at a discounted rate. If we are still living in a max rate world, though, this is not much of a concern since the use of the alternate points would also be at max rate. If we are planning to allow the winning bidder to use alternate points at a discounted rate, we should take out the statement that currently exists at the end of the paragraph. Please review my changes and let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

The key points are as follows: - WSI predicts warmer than normal winter temperatures in the northeast, mid-Atlantic, and central and southern plains, contrasting NOAA and SSB's expectation of a colder than normal winter in key energy consuming regions. - WSI expects cooler than normal temperatures in the Gulf Coast states, northern plains, Great Lakes states, and all areas west of the Rocky Mountains. - In November, cooler than normal temperatures are expected in the western half of the US, the northern plains, and Florida, while warmer than normal temperatures are expected across the central and southern plains and most of the eastern US. - In December, cooler than normal temperatures are anticipated across much of the country with the exception of the southeast, new england, and parts of the central Rockies. - In January, WSI forecasts warmer than normal temperatures across the central and southern plains, central Rockies, northeast, and mid-Atlantic states, while cooler than normal temperatures are expected along the Pacific coast, Southwest, northern Rockies, Northern Plains, and in the Ohio Valley. WSI's seven straight periods of accurate seasonal forecasts and their latest prediction for milder temperatures is bearish for gas and power prices. However, in the Western System Coordinator Council (WSCC), the outlook for cooler than average conditions will translate into higher levels of heating demand due to recent poor hydrogeneration conditions. Power supplies in regions like the Pacific Northwest and Northern California could be limited, which could lead to stronger power prices." }, { "body": "Dear Recipient, Thank you for your email regarding the impact of high natural gas prices on oil demand and supply. As per our analysis, high natural gas prices are indeed affecting us oil demand and supply. This trend is particularly prominent in North America where natural gas prices have increased nearly threefold in a year. Gas has lost market share to the heavy end of the barrel (residual fuel) but it also affects middle distillates. CERA estimates that the curtailment of gas supplies to interruptable customers combined with economically driven switching accounts for as much as 1 MBD of the strong year-on-year increase in US oil demand in January. However, for the short term, high gas prices are having a less pronounced effect on the oil supply side in the United States, about 0.5-1 MBD. In the spring, about 1 MBD of the gains in oil demand due to switching should be yielded back to the gas end.

This is expected to be similar to last year's cold season with sharp swings in temperature and precipitation. Key regions to watch include: 1. The Northeast and Midwest, expecting heavy lake effect snows and cold air outbreaks. 2. The South, anticipating cold air outbreaks and the potential for Noreasters along the East Coast. 3. The Pacific Northwest, where the number of heavy rain storms could be impacted by the Madden-Julian oscillation. The absence of a strong El Ni o or La Ni a climate pattern leaves the door open for a highly variable winter. This means the nation may experience winter weather extremes such as cold, snow, rain, and ice.

The line services markets between Texas and California. At midday Friday, El Paso began running approximately MMcf/d through Line A after receiving approval from the Federal Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS). El Paso was able to restart partial service on Line A by building a temporary connector line between Line A and Line B, which was approved by OPS. The temporary connector was installed just east of the Pecos River explosion site, about 15 miles from Carlsbad, NM. Line A will carry gas from Eunice, NM (just northeast of the Pecos River compressor station) to the connector with Line B. This gas will then travel westward across the Pecos River bridge where it will meet up with Line C downstream. Meanwhile, El Paso submitted test results and a preliminary return-to-service plan for Line A three days prior. The OPS gave El Paso permission to restore service to Line A from the Keystone station through the Pecos River compressor station at a reduced level. The pipeline reopened the line at about MMcf/d and gradually increased it to MMcf/d by Friday. This is still within the limits set by OPS. The OPS has restricted El Paso's Line A to 75% of its operating pressure at the time of the rupture, putting the line at about 1400 psi. The OPS ordered shutdown of Line A lasted for several days during which they ordered extensive hydrostatic ultrasound and X-ray tests to ensure the safety of the line and submitted a plan for restoring service to the line. As for the future of Line A, repairs will not begin until after the investigation of the explosion is completed. This could take 9-12 months. The disruption in service couldn't come soon enough for El Paso customers who have been scrambling for transportation capacity ever since federal investigators and regulators closed down the three lines that make up El Paso's south main leg following the blast that killed two and critically injured one. California customers have been taking gas out of storage to meet their needs during the service interruption. The Department of Energy has set up a task force to evaluate the effects of the explosion and shutdown on the gas market." }, { "body": "Thank you for updating us on the approval of the comprehensive settlement at yesterday's CPUC meeting regarding unbundling the SoCal system.

I received copies of the meeting notes from Michelle after Steve's staff meeting today. Lindy, I understand you will be back on Thursday, and I will be out the following week of August. I have some handouts from our previous meetings last year that we can start with. Please give me a call when you return, Lindy. Thanks, Ramona Original message: TBetancourt Ramona... --- Dear Dennis, Lisa, Trevino, Linda, Holmes, Dietz, Rick, Betancourt, Ramona... Tw Flow Direction Dennis, I do not have anything documented in any detail yet. Lindy is out on vacation. I know I will be reviewing the requirements with her. I will be working on the flow direction requirements over the next two to maybe weeks after discussing with Hasan. We plan to implement in the December-January time frame so that it moves in with TW's new contract system. This flow direction project was part of the TW system enhancement budget dollars. At the CMS status update meeting last week, Lisa noted these two items for TW. Also noted was a comment about needing the details on the within and outside the path. The within and outside the path is already coded in the current CBS system and PLE system. You should be able to pull from the current system the process I know it will need to merge into the new system. The basic concept is as all points on TW are tied to a marketing lateral code, this code is stored in PLE for each point on TW. A batch process is set up in CBS that is a stored procedure that runs everyday at noon to calculate the inside-outside the paths on all firm contracts. Release LFT EFBH. This process finds the marketing lateral for the primary receipt and primary delivery points, identifies all possible laterals between the primary receipt to primary delivery that can be valid alternate points inside the path and stores those to be used in the allocation process. It maps it out for each firm contract. This process uses the valid marketing laterals to build the inside alternate paths. Any contract whose alternate receipt or alternate delivery point that is not in the valid available marketing lateral is an outside the path transaction. TMS uses this process in the allocations on TW with revalidation. The TMS system checks for contracts that change primary receipt points and delivery points in the evening, non-grid I and cycles however the stored procedure batch job is a manual process. The contract team would submit this batch job on demand so that it can identify the valid marketing laterals for that specific contract that was changed. I would like to see this automated with the new CMS system each time a firm contract is changed for a gas day after the timely cycle is run, this batch job or stored procedure should automatically run again for that contract that was changed.

Here are some key points and questions arising from your email: - Regarding Kn Energy's transport contract, it seems the ROFR language is important but would require a max rate deal for a term of one year or longer. Has any offer been received yet from Kn by Monday operations? If not, should we follow up on this matter sooner? - There was an unusual knock sound coming from one of the units at Station High Western Flow. Have engineers identified the cause and implemented necessary repairs to prevent future occurrences? - The total capacity of the MMBTUD could be worth something in the low to mid KN range. Would it be beneficial to explore potential sales opportunities for this capacity, given the expected robust demand in August? - A letter was drafted for Stan's signature, outlining the circumstances and chronology of events leading up to your meeting with El Paso in June. It requests a payback of all the gas volume from that time. Why was the decision made not to attach a copy of the lawsuit filing to the letter? - Reliant extended their flex firm primary receipt and primary delivery at the West Texas Pool from July to August, but increased volumes from MMBTUDay to MMBTUDay. Is this adjustment expected to have any impact on our operations? - The new citizens interconnect for the Griffith Power Plant was scheduled to be purged and filled with gas this week. Enas verbally notified us that they may request some or all of the MMBTUD of primary delivery capacity for that point as soon as we receive their request in writing. What's our strategy when faced with such a request? - Duke Atokacrawford has proposed a construction contribution from TW, where they would build out part of their gathering system to unload MMBTUD off the Atoka lateral and redeliver gas to TWs Crawford lateral. This project could potentially allow TW to sell incremental space on the Atoka lateral in addition. What are our thoughts on this proposal, and what potential benefits does it offer for us? - Duke is also proposing to install additional compression to deliver up to MMBTUD of incremental volume to TW off the Zia plant in exchange for a discounted IT transport rate for a two-year term. This project would have a fuel saving benefit by eliminating one stage of compression from the low pressure system. What are our thoughts on this proposal, and how might it impact our operations?

The dramatic growth of EES requires considerable additional engineering and construction resources, both to develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers. Furthermore, in light of S's continued emphasis on increasing its return on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large-scale construction projects around the world. Historically, these projects have been a primary focus of EECCS activities. Therefore, we are making the following organizational changes: 1. The EECCS pipeline construction group led by Jerry Martin will become part of Transportation Services. 2. Nepco will continue to operate as a standalone entity focused on power plant construction services to entities and third parties. 3. The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.

I'm looking forward to attending this seminar as it aligns well with my professional interests. From your description, it appears that this course will delve deeper into deal structuring opportunities specific to the natural gas markets. I appreciate the emphasis on understanding the economic interrelationships between physical operations such as pipelines, storage, generation etc., and their synthetic financial counterparts. I'm particularly interested in learning about quantifying cash liquidity risk of futures margin requirements, specifying terms of futures contracts on NYMEX and KCBOT, structuring a fixed price hedge using a futures contract, and taking into account the implications of cash-futures basis in hedge design. Additionally, I'm excited to explore the benefits and risks of futures versus swaps, deciding between EFP or EFS to manage risk, recognizing the advantages and risks of stack and roll hedges, identifying time spreads as a risk and opportunity, and their relation to storage arbitrage. I'm also looking forward to learning about trading seasonal spreads and price curve shifts, identifying the options on time spreads embedded in storage, coordinating injection/withdrawal timing with the price curve, and understanding the risks of locational basis and its relationship to transport costs. Lastly, I'm keen to learn about utilizing intentional imbalances to extract value, using park and loan programs to make money, sell gas by wire through tolling mechanisms, buying or selling gas indexed to power or other energy prices, calculating spark spreads using generating heat rates, structuring multiple fuel hedges, understanding the optionality on spark spreads in gas-fired generation, offering gas-power dispatch options to gas generators, and much more.

SWG amended their transport contract start date to November. 3. TW resold the space along with an additional MMBtud for a total of MMBtud to Sempera Energy at a rate slightly above market but equal to the rate SWG was originally paying. 4. Morgan Gottsponer sold Sempera the gas for this transport deal. 5. The Burlington Resources Val Verde plant: We held another conference call with BR this week to resolve an outstanding issue regarding TW's obligation to take MMBtud from Burlington's Val Verde plant. Operational restrictions and San Juan temperatures affect the volume TW can receive from Val Verde. 6. BR claimed damages of nearly $X due to having to sell San Juan gas into less attractive markets because TW could not take all their volume. However, there were actually very few days in which TW hampered Burlington's deliveries. 7. TW has an exposure here for a contractual commitment that operationally we cannot meet on a year-round basis without spending several million dollars for additional compression. In exchange for Burlington signing an amended operating agreement, TW has agreed to refund $X in transport charges for gas moved this summer down the San Juan lateral. 8. We are working on a MMBtud east-to-east transport deal with Duke Energy beginning in January for one to two years at a rate of $X. This deal would justify the capital expenditure to replace the coolers at and give TW another MMBtud flow capacity on the West Texas Lateral. 9.

We have seen a significant rise in the number of vehicle accidents across our operating system this year, and it requires an immediate focus and action plan. To date, there have been more than twice as many vehicle accidents reported compared to the entire year's total. Seventeen of these accidents involved employees backing up and could have been prevented. Seven of these accidents involved an employee striking a fixed object, each of which also could have been avoided. Unfortunately, driver awareness training and continued communications have not significantly decreased the number of preventable accidents. To address this issue, we are implementing the following action plan: 1. Effective immediately, all vehicle operators are required to use the 'backing in' policy when parking and conduct a safety circle walk when leaving a parking space. This rule applies unless backing in causes a greater safety concern. 2. Employees involved in preventable vehicle accidents will be required to personally review the details of the accident with the Operations Regional Director and provide an overview of safe driving techniques at the next team safety meeting. 3. We are adjusting our common based objectives for all ETS personnel to include a safe driving component. Preventable accidents may impact a team's performance evaluation and could result in disciplinary action being enforced on the team or individual employee. 4. This action plan is designed to eliminate the rising number of motor vehicle collisions, not to create a burden but to ensure that all work is performed safely. I encourage everyone to join me in supporting this initiative to raise awareness that the safe operation of every vehicle is required and that each employee is responsible for their decisions when behind the wheel.

However, for the last years, the plant has been delivering gas with excess of our specs. 16. The latest amendment draft could use stronger language in terms of Tw's obligations beyond a best efforts basis. 17. John indicated a willingness to work together as they were trying to schedule a delivery of MMBtu to us for hub delivery. 18. A conference call was held with Mike Nelson, Rich Jolly, Steve January, Terry Galassini, Darrell Schoolcraft, Ray Smith, Gary Choquet, and David Roentsch regarding Tw's pressures and delivery capability at Socal Needles. 19. Analysis indicates there is a pressure drop from our Needles measurement station to the Socal station across the river approximately two miles. 20. Socal maintains that if we can give them psi at their station they can take the full MMBtu under the contract, which translates to psi at Tw's meter with our current situation. 21. Our problem has been if we lose volume out of San Juan or a unit on the west of Thoreau leg then we lose line pack and then pressure at the border, but Socal acknowledges they have a motor out of service at Needles but plan to have it back on line in October. 22. Operations has agreed to look at a number of things including changing the type of meter at Needles, looking at some station valve replacement, and mechanical condition of stations through marketing agreed to estimate the revenue impact of the pressure drop and lower volume delivery to help justify any capital expenditures." }, { "body": "Thank you for providing the estimate.

The report discusses the lessons that other states can learn from California's experience with electricity restructuring. The report suggests that competitive markets can work and competition is not to blame for California's problems. It offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry, such as maintaining a favorable investment and regulatory climate, ensuring enough generation capacity, transmission capacity, and natural gas pipeline capacity, among others. The report also emphasizes the importance of coordinating competition in retail and wholesale markets, and how properly restructuring can lead to lower prices, more choices for consumers, improved reliability, and better risk management. I believe you might find this report interesting as well. You can access it on Eric Hirst Consulting's website.

It's great to hear that the latest modifications, including the display of actual bids along with evaluated bids on each detail line, have been moved into production and are ready for testing. I understand that these enhancements will allow shippers to see the actual bid rate for all bids greater than max rate and calculate winning bids based on evaluated bid and term only, ignoring the time entered in the first column. It's also clear that now, a bid being ignored means it is a potential winner, not an actual winner, encouraging shippers to bid on the full volume of the package. I appreciate your clarification on this point. Regarding the modification that prevents users from superseding any of their own bids greater than or equal to max rate, I understand the rationale behind introducing a high risk factor and postponing its implementation until after Friday's iOS update. This seems reasonable considering some of these modifications affect the ranking of bids. I look forward to the thorough testing by your marketing team before shippers are allowed to enter the system." }, { "body": "This year, Houston voters have an exciting election ahead!

They are required to file these rates in their tariff daily, which could potentially be costly and time-consuming. This seems to be a strategy by the FERC to discourage indexed-based deals, as they may create administrative burdens. One suggested alternative is for Columbia Gas to post the actual rate on an internet website after each transaction, providing access to this information for similarly situated customers. I agree that we should discuss this issue with Columbia Gas and INGAA, and possibly consider filing for a rehearing on this matter." }, { "body": "Dear Team, I hope this message finds you well. I would like to discuss an important matter concerning our shared commitment to safety at work. Over the years, our team concept has brought about numerous opportunities for growth and improvements. We have celebrated accomplishments, built trust, and increased responsibilities as a team. However, a crucial aspect of this growth and maturity must include the realization and acceptance of our responsibility to monitor and enforce company policies and procedures. I have always emphasized that I will protect those who comply with and enforce our requirements. However, I have zero tolerance for those who choose not to do so. This year, several ETS employees received disciplinary action as a result of their failure to act or ignoring safe work practices. These cases were distributed to all employees in the form of a safety bulletin. I encourage everyone to learn from these instances to make our workplace even safer. I would like to share two examples from last year: 1. After repeatedly counseling a fellow team member who was violating several safety requirements, including hard hat and safety glasses usage, the team took action which ultimately resulted in this person being discharged. This harsh outcome was preferable to the person injuring themselves or even worse, a fellow team member. 2. Another team member chose to drive a company vehicle without using a seatbelt. The employee was involved in an accident, ejecting him from the vehicle and causing injuries that could have been prevented if the seat belt had been properly used. This employee is lucky to be alive. Using seat belts by all occupants of company vehicles is one of the most basic elements of our program and has been a requirement for over years. As the use of seatbelts is habit-forming, it is possible that this may have been the first time the employee failed to use them. It is also possible that other team members had observed this failure in the past but did not act. Could this have been prevented through positive interaction? Had positive interaction been taken but ignored when the Declaration of Interdependence was introduced, we made a commitment to each other that we would be our brothers and sisters keeper and remind each other of the need to comply with safety requirements at all times. While some employees may feel uncomfortable enforcing our requirements, that does not relieve anyone from their responsibility. Likewise, a team is responsible and accountable for the actions or lack of required action of each team member. Each individual team member and the team as a whole are responsible for the outcome and any disciplinary action that management may be required to take. I urge everyone to help us create the safest work environment possible. Our most important personal goal should be to do whatever it takes to arrive home safely each and every night, and we should expect nothing less from peers or members of our leadership to hold us accountable for doing just that.

Regarding the available connection, it is a side valve previously used for Highland-Pecos irrigation in Eddy County, New Mexico. The measuring facilities associated with the lateral and the Crawford Lateral were all sold to Duke Tw Measurement. Unfortunately, there are no existing measurement facilities at the interconnect that can be reactivated for EOG gas lift measurement. If EOG desires to receive lift gas from TWS, new measuring and regulating facilities will be required. I have included a figure below for connection details. As you mentioned, EOG's line pressure would need to be near psig to connect with TWS.

It's interesting to note that while the expansion is expected to be in the mmcf range, Williams plans to file an application with FERC to add additional dthd of firm transportation capacity from Wyoming to California markets. This proposed expansion, known as the California Expansion Project, could potentially pave the way for a second phase expansion. According to your email, the expansion is driven by rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power generation facilities in California. Kirk Morgan, Director of Business Development for Kern River and Northwest Pipeline, mentioned that Kern River is well-positioned to pursue an economically attractive expansion of its mainline. The proposal includes adding three new compressor stations as well as boosting or retooling existing facilities in Wyoming and Utah. Williams also plans to upgrade two meter stations with an anticipated inservice date being May. Back in August, Kern River held an open season to determine interest in firm year-round gas transportation service in Nevada and California and to determine interest for capacity relinquishment by existing shippers. The pipeline landed a number of contracts providing for delivery of Rockies supply into California. It seems that the demand for new capacity out of Wyoming is being driven by a shift in downstream markets for Canadian supply, strong economic growth in Kern market areas, and surging demand for gas-fired generation. Morgan mentioned that a ramp-up in Rockies production coupled with demand for competitive transportation promises a solid base for future expansion. Expansion on Kern River could help bring this production to market, as it currently delivers Rockies and Canadian supply to markets in California, Nevada, and Utah.

The smart pigging of the line between Eunice and Pecos River stations, originally scheduled for this Sunday, has been postponed one day. This will result in a reduction of MMcf/d flow through Eunice to the South Mainline, affecting deliveries to six interconnects, which unfortunately will not be able to deliver into El Paso for hours that day. Additionally, another smart pigging of the line between Pecos River and Guadalupe stations, scheduled for November, has also been postponed one day. This requires a reduction of MMcf/d through the Pecos River line, which may affect deliveries to Maricopa. Furthermore, pigging of the line between Maricopa and Gallup stations is scheduled for November, reducing the line's capacity by MMcf/d and potentially affecting deliveries of San Juan gas to the Phoenix area.

It appears that we have a few operational things to address before we can implement this change. As discussed in our meeting on Friday afternoon, it looks like this will be incremental and the supplies may not get scheduled. Also, I understand that Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI; however, I would like to confirm if they also confirm the Socal Topock point via EDI. If they do confirm via EDI, it would be beneficial to have them collaborate with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. It would also be helpful to know if they will provide us with a window similar to their current practice at the Socal Needles point today in TMS, where they don't confirm this cycle but have a non-grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at AM. Currently, the Socal Needles point is set up as a passive point for confirmation. The Socal Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. If they do confirm the Socal Topock point via EDI, Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice Request Form that is posted on the TW web site.

Your feedback from various demonstrations, surveys, and technology showcases has validated that email is a vital part of your ability to communicate effectively. However, your feedback also indicated that you need your email client to have additional functionality and increased integration with other applications you use. To meet the demands of today's fast-paced business networks, we are standardizing our email platform by deploying Microsoft Outlook to all the business units we currently support. For projects such as EBS, EES, and Azurix, project plans are still being finalized and will be communicated separately. This conversion from Lotus Notes to Outlook will improve your ability to communicate and provide a more consistent look and feel across the standard Office applications you use on a daily basis. We are excited about this opportunity to provide a more robust, full-function solution for your messaging needs. To provide you with additional details about the conversion from Lotus Notes to Outlook, we are including a list of frequently asked questions about this project: 1. How does this project affect me? Your current Lotus Notes email system will be converted to Microsoft Outlook. 2. What is Microsoft Outlook? Outlook is the messaging client you will use to read your email, update your calendar, and personal address book, record to-do lists, etc. 3. Why are we switching to Outlook? Outlook integrates more effectively with our new operating system, Windows, and the Microsoft products that currently use with Outlook. We can provide you with a more robust mail platform including instant messaging, ability to send person-to-person immediate popup messages, improved PDA synchronization, conferencing server, web access, fax integration, voice mail integration, and more. 4. When will the Outlook rollout start, and when will I get it? The pilot will begin in late October with the production rollout beginning in late November. We are finalizing our business unit rollout schedule. Additional information will be provided to all business units as it becomes available. Project updates will be posted on the project section of the IT Central web site at <com>. Additionally, you may send questions to <com>, and a member of the project team will be happy to address these individually." }, { "body": "Dear Teresa Knight, Executive Director at Houston Energy Association (HEA), Here's the breakdown of the pairings and tee assignments for Monday's tournament at The Oaks Course (formerly The West Course at The Woodlands Country Club).

The company has been accused of market manipulation by California state regulators, who argue that the high prices paid by power generators when the gas was delivered to Southern California compared to the lower spot price of gas bought in the Permian Basin is evidence of such practices. The article highlights a debate over oversight of the industry and questions whether the rising profits are due to robust markets responding to supply and demand signals or to market power and affiliate abuse. The company's CEO has denied any wrongdoing, stating that there are rules in place to protect against affiliate abuse. The article includes quotes from analysts who discuss El Paso's market capitalization, profits, and growth prospects, as well as criticism from critics who contend that the company set out to exploit volatile market conditions. The article also mentions a sealed document filed by El Paso merchant in response to California's complaint, which allegedly suggests that the company intended to make money by increasing the gas flow in the pipeline and widening the basis spread (the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end of the pipeline and what it could be sold for at the other end).

It's great to see both Agave Energy and Comanche Gathering looking to bring new gas onto the TWS system. The review of available taps to bring mmbtud into the system sounds promising. I also appreciate the information regarding the increase in TWS deliverability by mmbtud at Topock, effective December. This will certainly help us maximize revenue for the company. Congratulations to all the field operations personnel who contributed to resolving our contamination issues with PGE on a timely basis, and for building an atmosphere of trust and credibility. The market spreads between production basins and the California border have shown significant volatility this week, with contracting prices by Thursday due to weather fears and storage shortages across the US pushing prices up and down. It's impressive that we successfully negotiated the record-setting deals on PGE trading mmbtu for PGE trading mmbtu, and for Sempra mmbtu LFT for December transport options. Regarding our recent FERC filing, it's good to know that it's currently on the commission's docket for next Tuesday, November . We expect the commission to order a technical conference before the end of the year. Lastly, it's interesting to note that NGPL producers behind Marathon's Indian Basin plant are trying to move additional volume to TW via the recently reactivated NGPL Winkler interconnect. It seems that NGPL is evaluating cost options to add compression, which would also help us sell the point as a firm receipt point and extract more value." }, { "body": "Thank you for providing the long-awaited trip information.

This gas could potentially be sold westward through the Agave nominations under the EFHB rate schedule. Additionally, Agave could nominate a total of 'x' amount from these supply sources into the central pool. It is suggested that this gas doesn't need to flow through Agave's existing east facilities, and it could be done under EFHB if Agave didn't want to commit to incremental firm. However, they would have the obligation to flow. It seems that this option may merit a rate adjustment.

I've taken note of the suggestions and here are my thoughts on them: 1. **Provision 1**: As suggested, it's important to clarify the scope of services. However, instead of using a specific percentage or flat fee, we could use a flexible pricing model that adjusts based on the complexity and volume of tasks. This way, we can ensure fair compensation for our work without limiting our ability to adapt to changing project requirements. 2. **Provision 2**: Regarding the exclusivity clause, while it's understandable that NSS wants this to protect their interests, we prefer not to restrict our services to a single client. We believe that diversifying our client base will allow us to grow and provide better service in the long run. 3. **Provision 3**: The indemnification clause is necessary for protecting both parties, but we should ensure that it's balanced and fair. It would be best if we could work together on a mutual understanding of what constitutes a breach of duty, negligence, or infringement. 4. **Provision 4**: The termination clause should include a notice period and a process for resolving any disputes that may arise during the termination. This will help maintain a professional and collaborative relationship throughout the agreement's lifecycle. 5. **Provision 5**: The confidentiality clause is essential, but we prefer to keep it general rather than listing specific types of information. This approach allows for flexibility in addressing future developments that may not be currently anticipated. 6. **Provision 6**: Regarding the non-compete clause, while we understand NSS's concerns, it would be challenging for us to commit to this without hindering our ability to grow and adapt to market demands. Instead, we propose a reasonable restriction on soliciting NSS's current clients during the agreement term." }, { "body": "Thank you for informing me.

Two new long-term index-to-index transportation contracts were completed this week: one with Dynegy for calendar year from San Juan to the California border, and another with Calpine under similar terms. 2. Dynegy executed two short-term index-to-index contracts for November: an MMBTUD deal (Monthly Market Based Rate Daily Usage) and another for November-December (both deals are from San Juan to California). Hedges have been established on all the contracts to minimize exposure to market indexes. 3. BP-Amoco purchased two packages of space at max rates on the Ignacio to Blanco route, acquiring MMBTUD for calendar year and another for November with the exception of a small package of Permian to Cal border in November. All available firm transportation flowing west has now been sold out on TW through the end of the year. 4. ExxonMobil presented a proposal to inject a drag reducing agent into several segments along TW's system. This could potentially increase westward volume capacity by enhancing compressor efficiencies and providing increased corrosion protection. However, the final results of the NNG Cunningham test segment are still pending due to contamination issues on the mainline. It is expected that the san juan lateral pipe will be coated sometime before the second quarter. 5. TransColorado is evaluating outsourcing its entire back office operations, including legal, regulatory, accounting, and marketing requirements to a third-party provider. ETS has prepared a draft qualification statement to be submitted by January. TransColorado hopes to complete the transaction by late February. 6. Project McKinley (California border peak shaving) attended the marketing operations meeting in Long Beach this week to discuss the potential of injecting Natural Gas Liquids into TW's system to increase the BTU content of gas going into California. The project involves numerous logistical details, including deciding where to site the injection point, addressing railroad siding issues, NGL storage tanks, and possible contamination of downstream facilities. A follow-up meeting is planned for the end of January. 7. Online TW marketing representatives attended online training as they prepare to roll out capacity deals on the east end of TW's system. The plan is to begin selling by February, offering three to five packages per day of MMBTUD as market demand picks up. They will expand the offerings as needed. 8. The new interconnect with EPFS in Eddy County, NM is behind schedule. Initially committed to have TW's facilities finished by January, EPFS notified TW that there is still quite a bit of work left to do before gas can flow, including securing the row from the BLM for electric pole installation." }, { "body": "Dear Lana Moore, Director of Education at BBFinancialdoc, Thank you for your kind message.

The first phase (Phase I) will add DTHD of new firm capacity on Transco to serve five shippers starting from November. Phase II, scheduled for completion by November, will add DTHD to serve two more shippers. However, FERC denied requests by the State of New Jersey and the Department of Law and Public Safety to rescind and vacate an April certificate approving the construction of the entire MarketLink project. The Commission is requiring Transco to file executed contracts fully subscribing the remaining capacity within four months of the order. If the contracts are not filed, Transco cannot initiate eminent domain proceedings with respect to the remaining facilities covered by the original certificate. Additionally, FERC granted Questar a preliminary determination on non-environmental grounds, stating that its proposed Mainline Looping Project and interconnection with Kern River Pipeline is required by the public. The $1 million Questar project will add DTHD of capacity (ML) running from Coalseam reserves in the Uinta Basin near Price, Utah to Payson Citygate, and connect with Kern River.

I am writing to provide an update regarding the Southern Trails Salt Lake City project, specifically the portion of our pipeline in California. Unfortunately, due to state regulations, Questar Corporation has been forced to cancel part of this project. We went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors for our conversion work on the east of California portion of Southern Trails Pipeline. However, it is unlikely that the almost portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions. We are currently exploring optional uses and seeking a potential buyer for this section of the project. Whether any of the proposed mmcfd of supplies gets into California would depend on the takeaway capacity at the border and/or what a new operator on the California side might do with the pipeline.

The order was issued due to internal corrosion discovered on the failed section of pipeline. PHMSA is directing El Paso to submit a corrective action plan for its approval, which will identify all areas on approximately 340 miles of pipeline that may be subject to internal corrosion. If El Paso fails to comply with any part of the order, it could face civil penalties of up to $1 million per day and the case could be referred to the U.S. Attorney General for appropriate relief in the U.S. District Court.

I appreciate your estimate and the reminder about the potential major expense if the HP at the location is ever required. I have reviewed the information you provided, including the pictures of the station. Here are my comments: - The current free flow rates north on this lateral average around 1 MMCFD. - The gas supply is from the Leedy plant and various low pressure gathering interconnects. - The gas flows north bypassing the compression unit but utilizing the dehydration unit at ivanhoe. The gas ends up with NNG on the north side of the lateral. - The lipscomb lateral is isolated from the TW system at the Canadian River block valve. - The units at ivanhoe are idle and were designed for higher pressure delivery to NNG since they have not run in some time. It's probable that we will spend an additional to activate and upgrade the control panels and end devices. - To abandon these units, I would recommend either abandoning in place or holding them for future use. My guess is about $50,000 to pull spool pieces and blind flange the units. - I am aware that there is some drilling going on in the area, but I don't see a tremendous influx of supply to support the cost to utilize this lateral any differently than its current status." }, { "body": "Dear valued employees of And Reliant Energy, We are excited to invite you to an Arena Open Forum on Monday, October at noon.

However, FPL's shares dropped due to disappointment that FPL was not the takeover target. The combined company will serve over 50 million customers and have 120 GW of power generating capacity. FPL supplies electric service to about 10 million customers in Florida, while Entergy delivers electricity to approximately 10 million customers in parts of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The deal, a $30 billion merger, includes their combined market value of $125 billion, $65 billion of Entergy debt, and $79 billion of FPL debt. FPL shareholders will own 65% of the new company, and Entergy's board of directors will be comprised of members from both companies. To support the deal, FPL and Entergy plan to buy back a total of $10 billion in stock: $8 billion in FPL stock and $2 billion in Entergy stock. Each FPL shareholder will receive one share in the new company for each of its million diluted shares outstanding, while each Entergy shareholder would receive 0.75 shares in the new company for each of their million diluted shares outstanding. Shares of FPL fell more than $10 and Entergy shares fell more than $9 yesterday afternoon. Based on FPL's price on Monday morning, the deal values Entergy at around $68 per share. Many had speculated that FPL was to be bought rather than involved in a merger. The merger agreement includes a $1 billion breakup fee in case either side terminates the deal. The merger of FPL and Entergy must be approved by shareholders as well as federal regulators and is expected to close next year. The combined company expects to pay a dividend that is consistent with FPL's current dividend policy based on its current annual dividend of $2.50 per share. Entergy's shareholders would receive $1.87 per share compared with its current dividend of $1.67 per share. FPL's Broadhead will become the chairman, and Entergy CEO Leonard will become CEO of the new company. The expected annual cost savings and increased revenues for both competitive and regulated businesses may range from $2 billion to $3 billion, with about half the cost savings coming from workforce reductions mainly through attrition, growth, and voluntary retirement." }, { "body": "Dear Employee, I am forwarding the transcript of Steve Cooper's voicemail from earlier today.

Jim Crist, a lecturer with IGT, is preparing a daylong seminar customized to our interests and issues. Here's my top list on why GPG staff need to increase our understanding of the electric industry: 1. First and foremost, gas-fired electric generation is the growth market for gas pipelines. We need to get a sense of why and where generation is being built and who the likely customers are. 2. We need to understand electric utilities as customers: Who is the customer these days? The generator? Who should we be dealing with within the utility organization? What types of load patterns should we expect from various types of electric players? What types of services do they need? 3. We need to understand the regulatory climate on the electric side and the implications for electric generation demand growth. 4. We need to understand electric tariffs and practices, services, and OASIS because the FERC has started to insist on common rules between gas and electric. The recent electric interconnection policy has now been applied on the gas side; FERC is talking about imposing RTO principles on pipelines, and we hear a lot of comparisons between OASIS and pipeline EBBS. We want to learn how to take advantage of electric best practices where it makes sense and on the flip side know how to argue against the imposition of electric rules on our pipelines where there are legitimate differences between gas and electric.

The deal, which includes natural gas transmission pipelines, processing plants, and a natural gas storage field, was facilitated by a consent agreement signed this week. PG&E National Energy Group purchased the properties about three years ago for $3 billion but struggled to turn a profit. The basis between Waha in West Texas and Katy and the Houston ship channel has tightened since the purchase, making it difficult for PG&E to become a major player in the market. The assets, which also include significant natural gas liquids pipelines and fractionation facilities, serve all of Texas's major metropolitan areas, large industrial load centers, and several natural gas trading hubs. Before the sale to El Paso, the book value of these assets was estimated between $4-6 billion. Before buying PG&E's assets, El Paso was already an experienced player in the liquids game. Upon the completion of this deal, El Paso expects to actively manage the risk on the nonfee-based side as part of its normal review process. The consent agreement signed this week is subject to approval by the Federal Trade Commission and a similar agreement with the state of Texas. Once these agreements are approved, El Paso Energy expects to close the transaction in the fourth quarter." }, { "body": "Thank you for sharing the information regarding the PGE Gas Accord II proceeding.

The proposed bill aims to restore stability and reliability to the western energy market by directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to impose a temporary just and reasonable wholesale rate cap or cost-of-service based rates. Additionally, states involved will be required to pass on the cost of electricity to retail customers. However, they can determine how and when this would be done. For instance, California could opt for tiered pricing, real-time pricing, or set a baseline rate above which prices would be passed through. Senator Feinstein stated that FERC has found the wholesale prices being charged in California to be unjust and unreasonable. This legislation aims to mandate that once FERC makes such a finding, the agency will carry out its regulatory role. FERC is a million-dollar agency tasked with regulating the energy marketplace, and this bill seeks to provide a period of reliability and stability during a crisis. Unfortunately, FERC has refused to act in this regard. California's broken electricity market is a result of a flawed California law that deregulated wholesale costs but left in place caps on retail prices. This was coupled with a requirement that utilities divest themselves of their generating capacity and buy most of their electricity on the spot market where prices have escalated dramatically. In hindsight, this combination has led to a catastrophic scenario, resulting in California buying electricity at astronomical prices today." }, { "body": "It appears that the message contains a repetitive pattern of 'westttt san juant eastttt' for each day of the week.

The root cause of the problem is a lack of new generation, and the high cost of power incurred by California's utilities. The current credit crisis threatens supplies and may lead to state action to address the situation. The focus should be on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible. Western power prices have skyrocketed, and regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms due to frozen rates that insulate consumers from tangible effects of the market crisis.

Furthermore, there was no decision on whether a hearing or settlement would be pursued for a final decision. It's worth noting that additional allocation studies have been requested by shippers to better understand the impacts of seasonalization, winter and summer conditions, and the difference between CD and FR requirements. It seems that El Paso interprets their studies as showing the proposed capacity allocation method is workable, but shippers remain skeptical. Lastly, there was a question raised about whether shippers could designate specific receipt points rather than pools. It's important to clarify commission policy on pools vs receipt points and address the procedural schedule for further studies and responses.

SOCAL will not set the capacity at Needles lower than necessary, unless they encounter operational problems. However, they will maintain the capacity for a gas day during all cycles. This is good news for both SOCAL and TW. 2. SOCAL may set a capacity higher than usual if they do so, they will maintain that capacity for a gas day during all cycles only in case of specific operational problems. This is also beneficial for TW and SOCAL. 3. Starting from November, SOCAL can call an Operational Flow Order (OFO) at the beginning of each cycle for the gas day. This could potentially cause a confirmation reduction. From now on, they can call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle including intraday and intraday cycles which are part of the gas day. This is expected to have a major impact on SOCAL's customers. 4. Despite the windowing supposedly being removed, SOCAL will still provide a capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations exceed their capacity. 5. If SOCAL reduces scheduled volumes after an allocation, it will be due to their market not burning their schedule at that time. 6. SOCAL will confirm down to the market burn overall. 7. If you have any questions, please let me know. Thanks, Lynn" }, { "body": "Dear Team, I am writing to provide an update on recent negotiations and contract extensions. We successfully extended the MMBTUD East-to-West contract with Aquila USGT, effective from November, with a reservation rate of . Additionally, we have improved the economics of their existing contract, with a new rate effective February through October, on the alternate west flow. We also negotiated a similar deal for the alternate west flow with Astra Power LLC. Their reservation rate is on a volume of , for a term from March through March. These two deals, along with the anticipated closing of the Public Service of New Mexico contract, will effectively sell out the east end of the TW system through at least San Juan flow conditioner. In other news, we postponed until March the application of the ExxonMobilco flow conditioner in the San Juan Lateral. Had we proceeded with the application in February, a tariff month, the minimum lost revenue impact for one day could have been Southwest Gas. We received the fully executed OBA contract from Southwest Gas this week. With gas inventory moderating temperatures out west reducing demand and shippers paying gas back to TW, we were experiencing high linepack for most of the week. TW was able to sell mmbtu at the border for a net revenue of . Lastly, we negotiated a San Juan Pool contract for MMBTUD at max rates for February.

Here's a summary of the key points discussed: 1. We are taking every measure possible to safeguard investor interests and regain confidence. 2. Our focus remains on credit quality, balance sheet, and liquidity, which are crucial for continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses. 3. It has taken more than a few weeks to reach our current state, and here's a brief overview of significant events that led us here. 4. Unfortunately, we made some poor investments in non-core businesses over the past years, such as Azurix India and Brazil. These investments have underperformed significantly. 5. As a result, we have become overleveraged as a company. The negative impact of these investments was amplified through extensive use of debt capital on and off our balance sheet, related party transactions, and loss of investor confidence. 6. We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures. 7. Last week, we discovered errors in our financial statements that required a restatement of previously reported earnings. 8. Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They are our competitive advantage, including natural gas pipeline businesses, gas and power businesses in North America and Europe, retail businesses in North America and Europe, and coal businesses in North America and Europe. 9. The events of the past few weeks have temporarily impacted our projected fourth-quarter profitability, but it's too early to predict the long-term effect on our operating results. 10. We are taking actions to quickly return to normal business operations. Regarding non-core businesses: 11. These include our Global Assets Group and Broadband Division, which we have invested more than $1 billion in. The return from these businesses has been poor. 12. We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. 13. More than $1 billion worth of assets are already contracted for sale this year, including Ceg Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil, Ecoelectrica (a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico), and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. 14. The approximately $1 billion Portland General sale is also on track to close pending regulatory approvals. Regarding businesses under review: These operations are outside our Power and Gas Wholesale Businesses and include Global and Industrial Markets. While several of these businesses have strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient in terms of earnings and cash generation. We will continue to update you regularly as more information becomes available. Credit Filing: We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies. We believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment-grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows: - Moody's: Under Review for Further Downgrade - Fitch: BBB Evolving Status, CreditWatch Negative - S&P: Not specified in the email. We discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin, and Yosemite, in detail. We will file our report five days late due to our current activities, which will be filed on Nov .
