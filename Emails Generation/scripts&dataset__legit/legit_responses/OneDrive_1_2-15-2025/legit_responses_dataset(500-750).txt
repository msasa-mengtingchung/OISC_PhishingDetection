The change was requested by Socal last Friday, lowering the window below TWS's firm requirements. This is not the usual practice followed by both parties. The letter attached to the email was faxed to Shelly Corman. Patricia Davidson from Socal Gas Scheduling Manager and Lynn Lohman from TWPSD Capacity Policy have agreed to accommodate any changes, increases or decreases to the window during a particular gas day, except for the intraday cycle. The change in the allocation during the intraday cycle would create imbalances on TWS's system, which is against its tariff rules.

    "body": "Thank you for providing the details about the recent realignments and changes in transport contracts. Here are some key points from your email: \n\n1. Capacity Marketing PGE Trading has realigned several transport contracts, including a pre-arranged capacity release deal with Texaco for June-October, with Topock delivery capacity at index formula-based rates.\n2. However, Texaco is not utilizing Topock and has chosen to re-deliver the gas to Citizens East of the Cal border.\n3. Short-term April capacity deals have been arranged with El Paso Field Services (EPFS) to deliver another MMBTUD to TWS West Texas Lateral as early as May, through the new Eddy County NM interconnect.\n4. Tw has informed that they will decline to share in the cost of expanding the interconnect at this point.\n5. Agave and Duke have regulatory reasons for not taking gas off the LEC and re-delivering it to the Crawford Lateral.\n6. Ngpl met with Business Development Reps this week to discuss various interconnects between Ngpl and TWS East system.\n7. Ngpl is conducting an open season on expanding the takeaway capacity on their line from the Marathon Indian Basin Plant.\n8. To access TWS high pressure system, Ngpl needs to add HP of mainline compression plus a HP booster compressor.\n9. The additional horsepower would only bring an estimated MMBTUD incremental to TWS.\n10. TW is planning to evaluate the cost of the booster compressor facility and possibly size a larger booster to gain additional throughput capability on the West Texas Lateral.\n\nRegarding FERC negotiated rate filings, TW must explain why its actions in offering the negotiated rate contracts were not in contravention of commission policy. They must also provide information about the availability of firm capacity on their system and how they can move gas under the transactions under investigation without interruption.\n\nLastly, Caithness has requested a budget quality cost estimate for tying the power plant exclusively to TW. Caithness will install approximately miles of line to reach TW, with an in-service date for the plant projected as August. Phase 1 will consume MMBTUD and Phase 2 will take an incremental MMBTUD."

Additionally, you will discuss other general business matters. Your action plan with legal and credit was discussed, and full payment by January latest is expected, effective February with penalty payments for any future imbalance outside the tolerance level. You also mentioned that Pogo Producing plans to spud a well in Eddy County, an offset to the EOG operated well recently completed and being attached to TW. The well will be spud in December with an expected day drill completion time, and production is expected to be close to the EOG well's current initial production of MMCFD. Pogo also plans additional drilling in the field area. \n\nRegarding CIG, a conference call was held on Friday to discuss delivery performance issues and the ability of them to increase their delivery capacity to TW at Tumbleweed. It was mentioned that CIG is currently fully subscribed and operating at MAOP along the line which provides deliveries to TW, El Paso NNG, and SPSNichols. They have no operational capability to provide any more incremental delivery capabilities to TW at Tumbleweed currently, but a second Raton expansion project will be announced in March, and looping of this southern line could potentially provide incremental delivery capacity to TW above the current MMCFD level. \n\nYou also mentioned that you will have additional discussions with CIG marketing individuals to determine who besides El Paso and Evergreen are the primary existing shippers down the southern portion of CIG's system in order to potentially get them to realign their contract to TW as a primary delivery point. You discussed the expediting of the contracting process per Kevin's request, and several ideas were discussed which would streamline and improve the existing contract processing cycle. The most important recommendation was to revise the year-old ETS discounting policy, which Bill Cordes had established for both TW and Northern, in order to simplify the officer approval process and expedite turnaround time."

MMBTUday was borrowed from PG&E in September and sold to USGT as a ride and park deal at TH. Payback to PG&E has completed as of September. Our monthly roundtable discussion with TH Market Services was held this week, where we gave a brief presentation on the proposed transport options tariff filing and its impact on the TH system.\n\n2. We attended Sempera Energy Trading's weather derivatives briefing chaired by their chief meteorologist Dan Guertin. Dans forecast for the winter of 20XX seems to track with the CPCs forecast. He sees slightly above average temperatures for the western marketplace and a relatively normal winter pattern for the midcontinent.\n\n3. The settlement letter to net out the imbalances between TW, NNG, and El Paso was drafted and sent to El Paso this week for their signature. El Paso has indicated they will respond next week as most of their management is scrambling with the recent reorganization announcement.\n\n4. Burlington Resources Val Verde plant facility planning indicates it will take another HP compressor costing $10 million in order for TW to be able to meet our contractual requirements year-round with Burlington in San Juan. With this uneconomical prospect, we will try and negotiate a yearly average receipt capability versus a daily receipt capability.\n\n5. Burlington reported in Gas Daily this week that their overall production will be down for the third quarter due to processing and treating efficiency problems associated with summer heat in the San Juan Basin and continued mechanical downtime.\n\n6. We had an initial meeting with Koch Midstream Services Company regarding the Coyanosa plant currently connected to Transwestern's most southern area of the West Texas Lateral. Koch does not have equity gas of their own at this plant but has offered to provide us the names of companies who do process gas at the plant. Tailgate gas from the Coyanosa plant is currently sold at the Waha index. Koch's Coyanosa plant is one plant which would potentially provide additional supplies (300 MMcf/d total plant capacity) to Transwestern as part of the Gomez to Puckett tie-in project.\n\nRegards,\n[Your Name]"

We are open to setting a time for Wednesday afternoon to discuss further.\n\nRegarding the MHQ delivery, it appears there should be no problem in delivering it in an hour block as planned. The contract rate will be a negotiated rate, which eliminates rate risk for Gila. The current rate design is one-part with no differentiation between reservation and commodity.\n\nThe rate does not include AGA GRI surcharges or fuel. It covers a minimal return on the project's capital cost plus the ongoing O&M fuel costs. The offer to Panda is consistent with the current tariff.\n\nAs the term gets shorter, the rate will inevitably increase to cover the return hurdles and delivery pressure at the Panda EPNG interconnect. We recommend a minimum capacity of the lateral from Copper Eagle to EPNG for delivery. If Panda is willing to commit to taking capacity in the project, we can provide the necessary flexibility to move gas to other destinations at the contract rate.\n\nIf plant demand was reduced, you would have all the flexibility to move gas to alternative markets.\n\nWe understand there might be daily imbalances and short-notice start-ups/shuts. We plan for the worst case scenario, assuming there is no storage. However, due to the size of the project pipe and pressure, we will have some flexibility, although this depends on what other shippers are doing.\n\nRegarding Southpoint Griffith, I'm not sure about the specific actions taken, but we can follow up with our team for more information.\n\nLooking forward to our discussion on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]"

They are looking at alternative uses for the California portion of the pipeline, such as operating it as a petroleum or liquids line carrying product from the Long Beach harbor area to existing petroleum or liquid products pipelines in and around the California-Arizona border.

    }, This text appears to be a market analysis and forecast for natural gas prices in various regions of the United States, provided by Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA). The analysis discusses factors affecting supply and demand, such as hydroelectric output, pipeline utilization rates, and regional power demands. It also mentions the potential expansion of the mile pipeline from Wyoming into Nebraska, which could prevent bottlenecks in the region.

The text suggests that gas prices are expected to increase significantly in various regions, particularly in California, due to increasing demand for natural gas for power generation and reduced hydroelectric output. The analysis also predicts that differentials between key hubs like Malin, Henry Hub, Topock, and San Juan will widen during the summer months as regional demands grow.

The text concludes with a call-to-action to visit a URL or contact CERA for more information about this monthly briefing, including associated graphics and tables., {

Despite this delay, we will continue to invoice SWG for transportation under their firm contract beginning November.\n\nAdditionally, during an inspection this week, TW Engineering noticed that SWG had installed a bypass valve on their meter station at the new facility.

If there is a difference in volumes that could not be attributed to rounding, it needs to be verified if it is caused by makeup volumes. If delivery makeup was scheduled, then the invoice should be adjusted accordingly.\n8. A final copy of the delivery tolerance report should be provided to both Elizabeth and Marketing so it can be determined if makeup will affect the rate to be charged.\n9.

    "body": "The factors leading to higher natural gas prices this winter include increased demand, particularly in the power generation market and manufacturing sector, as well as a decrease in natural gas production and drilling due to low prices. The production from increased drilling activity is not immediately available as it takes several months for the gas to become usable. The past three winters have been warmer than normal, which may have artificially masked usual consumption patterns under normal weather conditions. This summer's warm weather has caused a significant increase in demand for natural gas in the electricity generation sector, competing with gas storage injections and driving prices upward. US storage inventory levels are currently lower than historical average levels of the past six years, which could eliminate the traditional price advantage of winter heating fuels like propane and heating oil this winter."

I have revised the paragraph to align with our last posting and included a sentence stating that tie-breakers will be decided by lottery, although I omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time.\n\nMy only other comment is that I believe the group needs to discuss beforehand how a shipper's request for alternate points will be treated, as currently drafted this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on use of alternate points at the bid rate. This raises questions about our granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount if we do intend to let the winning bidder shipper use alt points at a discounted rate. If we are still living in a max rate world, though, this is not much of a concern since the use of the alternate points would also be at max rate. If we are planning to allow the winning bidder to use alternate points at a discounted rate, we should take out the statement that currently exists at the end of the paragraph.\n\nPlease review my changes and let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest,\nChristine Stokes"

The key points are as follows: \n\n- WSI predicts warmer than normal winter temperatures in the northeast, mid-Atlantic, and central and southern plains, contrasting NOAA and SSB's expectation of a colder than normal winter in key energy consuming regions.\n- WSI expects cooler than normal temperatures in the Gulf Coast states, northern plains, Great Lakes states, and all areas west of the Rocky Mountains.\n- In November, cooler than normal temperatures are expected in the western half of the US, the northern plains, and Florida, while warmer than normal temperatures are expected across the central and southern plains and most of the eastern US.\n- In December, cooler than normal temperatures are anticipated across much of the country with the exception of the southeast, new england, and parts of the central Rockies.\n- In January, WSI forecasts warmer than normal temperatures across the central and southern plains, central Rockies, northeast, and mid-Atlantic states, while cooler than normal temperatures are expected along the Pacific coast, Southwest, northern Rockies, Northern Plains, and in the Ohio Valley.\n\nWSI's seven straight periods of accurate seasonal forecasts and their latest prediction for milder temperatures is bearish for gas and power prices. However, in the Western System Coordinator Council (WSCC), the outlook for cooler than average conditions will translate into higher levels of heating demand due to recent poor hydrogeneration conditions. Power supplies in regions like the Pacific Northwest and Northern California could be limited, which could lead to stronger power prices."

     "body": "Dear Recipient,\n\nThank you for your email regarding the impact of high natural gas prices on oil demand and supply.\n\nAs per our analysis, high natural gas prices are indeed affecting us oil demand and supply. This trend is particularly prominent in North America where natural gas prices have increased nearly threefold in a year. Gas has lost market share to the heavy end of the barrel (residual fuel) but it also affects middle distillates.\n\nCERA estimates that the curtailment of gas supplies to interruptable customers combined with economically driven switching accounts for as much as 1 MBD of the strong year-on-year increase in US oil demand in January. However, for the short term, high gas prices are having a less pronounced effect on the oil supply side in the United States, about 0.5-1 MBD.\n\nIn the spring, about 1 MBD of the gains in oil demand due to switching should be yielded back to the gas end.

The Northeast and Midwest, expecting heavy lake effect snows and cold air outbreaks.\n2. The South, anticipating cold air outbreaks and the potential for Noreasters along the East Coast.\n3. The Pacific Northwest, where the number of heavy rain storms could be impacted by the Madden-Julian oscillation.\n\nThe absence of a strong El Nio or La Nia climate pattern leaves the door open for a highly variable winter.

The deal is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is projected to close late next year. After the closure, Chuck Watson will serve as Chairman and CEO of the new company, Dynegy Inc., while Steve Bergstrom will be President and COO. You will continue as Chairman and CEO until the transaction closes. The merger process is expected to be long and complex and may result in some position eliminations. The optimal structure of the new company will be identified, with efforts made to minimize involuntary separations through attrition and hiring reductions. Additional details regarding the integration team and FAQs are available on the company's website. If you receive media inquiries, please refer them to the media team.

This is particularly noticeable for TransCanada Pipelines and PGE Gas Transmission in their GTNW line from Alberta to British Columbia and into the PGE systems. The high demand in the Pacific Northwest, California, and Midwest has not lessened, with every power plant in the region running at full capacity. Transcanada's other major export route, the Foothills and Northern Border route into the Midwest, is also operating at high load factors. However, there have been more frequent intraday nomination changes due to the volatility of the flows caused by the price differential between AECO and the Dawn hub in Ontario. The Alliance pipeline has been running at BCFD since commercial service began in December and is expected to soon test to increase flows on the system."

     "body": "The El Paso South System pipeline, damaged in the deadly explosion in southeastern New Mexico about two weeks ago, has had over MMcf/d of its BCf/d capacity restored on its south mainline. The line services markets between Texas and California. At midday Friday, El Paso began running approximately MMcf/d through Line A after receiving approval from the Federal Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS).\n\nEl Paso was able to restart partial service on Line A by building a temporary connector line between Line A and Line B, which was approved by OPS. The temporary connector was installed just east of the Pecos River explosion site, about 15 miles from Carlsbad, NM.\n\nLine A will carry gas from Eunice, NM (just northeast of the Pecos River compressor station) to the connector with Line B. This gas will then travel westward across the Pecos River bridge where it will meet up with Line C downstream.\n\nMeanwhile, El Paso submitted test results and a preliminary return-to-service plan for Line A three days prior. The OPS gave El Paso permission to restore service to Line A from the Keystone station through the Pecos River compressor station at a reduced level. The pipeline reopened the line at about MMcf/d and gradually increased it to MMcf/d by Friday. This is still within the limits set by OPS.\n\nThe OPS has restricted El Paso's Line A to 75% of its operating pressure at the time of the rupture, putting the line at about 1400 psi. The OPS ordered shutdown of Line A lasted for several days during which they ordered extensive hydrostatic ultrasound and X-ray tests to ensure the safety of the line and submitted a plan for restoring service to the line.\n\nAs for the future of Line A, repairs will not begin until after the investigation of the explosion is completed. This could take 9-12 months.\n\nThe disruption in service couldn't come soon enough for El Paso customers who have been scrambling for transportation capacity ever since federal investigators and regulators closed down the three lines that make up El Paso's south main leg following the blast that killed two and critically injured one. California customers have been taking gas out of storage to meet their needs during the service interruption.\n\nThe Department of Energy has set up a task force to evaluate the effects of the explosion and shutdown on the gas market."

Lindy, I understand you will be back on Thursday, and I will be out the following week of August.\n\nI have some handouts from our previous meetings last year that we can start with. Please give me a call when you return, Lindy. Thanks,\nRamona\n\nOriginal message: TBetancourt Ramona...\n\n--- \nDear Dennis, Lisa, Trevino, Linda, Holmes, Dietz, Rick, Betancourt, Ramona...\nTw Flow Direction\nDennis, I do not have anything documented in any detail yet. Lindy is out on vacation. I know I will be reviewing the requirements with her. I will be working on the flow direction requirements over the next two to maybe weeks after discussing with Hasan. We plan to implement in the December-January time frame so that it moves in with TW's new contract system. This flow direction project was part of the TW system enhancement budget dollars.\n\nAt the CMS status update meeting last week, Lisa noted these two items for TW. Also noted was a comment about needing the details on the within and outside the path. The within and outside the path is already coded in the current CBS system and PLE system. You should be able to pull from the current system the process I know it will need to merge into the new system. The basic concept is as all points on TW are tied to a marketing lateral code, this code is stored in PLE for each point on TW.\n\nA batch process is set up in CBS that is a stored procedure that runs everyday at noon to calculate the inside-outside the paths on all firm contracts. Release LFT EFBH. This process finds the marketing lateral for the primary receipt and primary delivery points, identifies all possible laterals between the primary receipt to primary delivery that can be valid alternate points inside the path and stores those to be used in the allocation process.\n\nIt maps it out for each firm contract. This process uses the valid marketing laterals to build the inside alternate paths. Any contract whose alternate receipt or alternate delivery point that is not in the valid available marketing lateral is an outside the path transaction. TMS uses this process in the allocations on TW with revalidation. The TMS system checks for contracts that change primary receipt points and delivery points in the evening, non-grid I and cycles however the stored procedure batch job is a manual process.\n\nThe contract team would submit this batch job on demand so that it can identify the valid marketing laterals for that specific contract that was changed. I would like to see this automated with the new CMS system each time a firm contract is changed for a gas day after the timely cycle is run, this batch job or stored procedure should automatically run again for that contract that was changed.\n\nThanks,\nRamona\n\n--- \nDear Dennis,\nJuly AM Ramona : Tw Flow Direction\nRamona, let me know please,\nThanks,\nDennis\n\nOriginal message: TTrevino Linda...\nTw Flow Direction\nDennis, I noticed on Ramonas bullets she was working with marketing and contracts on the Tw flow direction business requirements.

Here are some key points and questions arising from your email:\n\n- Regarding Kn Energy's transport contract, it seems the ROFR language is important but would require a max rate deal for a term of one year or longer. Has any offer been received yet from Kn by Monday operations? If not, should we follow up on this matter sooner?\n\n- There was an unusual knock sound coming from one of the units at Station High Western Flow. Have engineers identified the cause and implemented necessary repairs to prevent future occurrences?\n\n- The total capacity of the MMBTUD could be worth something in the low to mid KN range. Would it be beneficial to explore potential sales opportunities for this capacity, given the expected robust demand in August?\n\n- A letter was drafted for Stan's signature, outlining the circumstances and chronology of events leading up to your meeting with El Paso in June. It requests a payback of all the gas volume from that time. Why was the decision made not to attach a copy of the lawsuit filing to the letter?\n\n- Reliant extended their flex firm primary receipt and primary delivery at the West Texas Pool from July to August, but increased volumes from MMBTUDay to MMBTUDay. Is this adjustment expected to have any impact on our operations?\n\n- The new citizens interconnect for the Griffith Power Plant was scheduled to be purged and filled with gas this week. Enas verbally notified us that they may request some or all of the MMBTUD of primary delivery capacity for that point as soon as we receive their request in writing. What's our strategy when faced with such a request?\n\n- Duke Atokacrawford has proposed a construction contribution from TW, where they would build out part of their gathering system to unload MMBTUD off the Atoka lateral and redeliver gas to TWs Crawford lateral. This project could potentially allow TW to sell incremental space on the Atoka lateral in addition. What are our thoughts on this proposal, and what potential benefits does it offer for us?\n\n- Duke is also proposing to install additional compression to deliver up to MMBTUD of incremental volume to TW off the Zia plant in exchange for a discounted IT transport rate for a two-year term. This project would have a fuel saving benefit by eliminating one stage of compression from the low pressure system. What are our thoughts on this proposal, and how might it impact our operations?\n\nLooking forward to discussing these matters further."

      "body": "The email discusses concerns raised by certain shippers about Kern River Gas Transmission's selling of capacity in their open season, particularly regarding access to markets on the Southern California Gas (SOCAL) system through Wheeler Ridge. The shippers claim that Kern has oversold capacity at Wheeler Ridge and its proposed expansion project will exacerbate the situation. They have requested the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to stop Kern River from overselling delivery point rights at Wheeler Ridge into the Southern California Gas Co distribution system. The shippers also argue that the proposed expansion will degrade their firm delivery rights in Southern California and restrict the firm rights of existing shippers. They suggest that FERC should prohibit Kern from selling additional firm rights at Wheeler Ridge or provide only rights to secondary and tertiary capacity, which are of a lower priority than the rights of existing firm customers."

The dramatic growth of EES requires considerable additional engineering and construction resources, both to develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.\n\nFurthermore, in light of S's continued emphasis on increasing its return on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large-scale construction projects around the world. Historically, these projects have been a primary focus of EECCS activities. Therefore, we are making the following organizational changes:\n\n1. The EECCS pipeline construction group led by Jerry Martin will become part of Transportation Services.\n2. Nepco will continue to operate as a standalone entity focused on power plant construction services to entities and third parties.\n3. The remainder of EECC will become part of EES. Larry Izo will report to the EES office of the Chairman.\n\nThese changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth opportunities within EES and provide new and exciting opportunities for our employees.

    6. BR claimed damages of nearly $X due to having to sell San Juan gas into less attractive markets because TW could not take all their volume. However, there were actually very few days in which TW hampered Burlington's deliveries.
    7. TW has an exposure here for a contractual commitment that operationally we cannot meet on a year-round basis without spending several million dollars for additional compression. In exchange for Burlington signing an amended operating agreement, TW has agreed to refund $X in transport charges for gas moved this summer down the San Juan lateral.
    8. We are working on a MMBtud east-to-east transport deal with Duke Energy beginning in January for one to two years at a rate of $X. This deal would justify the capital expenditure to replace the coolers at and give TW another MMBtud flow capacity on the West Texas Lateral.
    9. Duke wants alternative flow capability west to the border at an incremental cost of $X as an alternative, we are proposing an index-based sharing mechanism for the West flow, but Duke is balking. The current market for calendar net of fuel is $X."

Cera predicts that U.S. working storage inventories as of the end of October were approximately 3.5 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), which is an all-time low for that date. The weekly storage injections were higher than a normal weather pattern would indicate but more normal weather for the remainder of the month would result in withdrawals averaging 0.16 Tcf per day during November, which is moderately high compared to historical standards but higher than occurred in the past two years. This pace of withdrawals places inventories on a path toward an end-of-March minimum of 2.5 Tcf under normal winter weather conditions, with only 0.5 Tcf above the previous all-time low. The market remains tight and some demand must still be priced out of the market in order to preserve storage inventories.

       "body": "Subject: Important Safety Measures Regarding Motor Vehicle Collisions\n\nAs you are aware, safety is our top priority at ETS. We have seen a significant rise in the number of vehicle accidents across our operating system this year, and it requires an immediate focus and action plan.\n\nTo date, there have been more than twice as many vehicle accidents reported compared to the entire year's total. Seventeen of these accidents involved employees backing up and could have been prevented. Seven of these accidents involved an employee striking a fixed object, each of which also could have been avoided.\n\nUnfortunately, driver awareness training and continued communications have not significantly decreased the number of preventable accidents. To address this issue, we are implementing the following action plan:\n\n1. Effective immediately, all vehicle operators are required to use the 'backing in' policy when parking and conduct a safety circle walk when leaving a parking space. This rule applies unless backing in causes a greater safety concern.\n\n2. Employees involved in preventable vehicle accidents will be required to personally review the details of the accident with the Operations Regional Director and provide an overview of safe driving techniques at the next team safety meeting.\n\n3. We are adjusting our common based objectives for all ETS personnel to include a safe driving component. Preventable accidents may impact a team's performance evaluation and could result in disciplinary action being enforced on the team or individual employee.\n\n4. This action plan is designed to eliminate the rising number of motor vehicle collisions, not to create a burden but to ensure that all work is performed safely.\n\nI encourage everyone to join me in supporting this initiative to raise awareness that the safe operation of every vehicle is required and that each employee is responsible for their decisions when behind the wheel. Safety in every decision, practice, promotion, and uncompromised."

The size of the interconnect will be MMBtu and EPFS has agreed to pay towards the cost estimate.\n\n2. EPFS has also committed MMBtu throughput for a period of years.\n\n3. Facility planning is opening a new work order and drafting the interconnect agreement and the OBA for the new point, which should be active in a few days.\n\n4. Arizona Public Service (APS) has not signed the transport request for MMBtu capacity from April to October.\n\n5. The current spread is red cedar, who has finally decided on their transport volume under our new year agreement.\n\n6. Documentation for this move is being prepared.\n\n7. Sempra has exercised their option under their Gallup contract for MMBtu Permian to California for the year starting [contract rate + fuel].\n\n8. Texaco is moving up to MMBtu from PGE Topock to Mojave, starting [starting date] through Tw.\n\n9. An incremental was collected for this move or approximately $X.\n\n10. El Paso is currently experiencing an outage and the Office of Pipeline Safety is demanding hydro test, xray, and ultrasonic tests on all miles of pipe that are currently out of service due to last weekends explosion.\n\n11. It appears the BCFD capacity to California may be offline for up to one month.\n\n12. Related developments: Socal released capacity on El Paso for October to Dynegy at a reservation charge of volume on various Tw interconnect points. There has also been an increase in incremental volume from El Paso at Window Rock and collection of a portion of the market premium transport options.\n\n13. A working group meeting with customers has been scheduled for Thursday, August [date] to get everyone comfortable and build a coalition of support behind our new options tariff filing.\n\n14. Burlington Resources held a conference call with John Hinton, Marketing Director regarding the current operation of the Val Verde plant.\n\n15. Our data indicates that with the exception of a few temperature limit days, Tw has been able to accept over of the gas nominated by the plant. However, for the last years, the plant has been delivering gas with excess of our specs.\n\n16. The latest amendment draft could use stronger language in terms of Tw's obligations beyond a best efforts basis.\n\n17. John indicated a willingness to work together as they were trying to schedule a delivery of MMBtu to us for hub delivery.\n\n18. A conference call was held with Mike Nelson, Rich Jolly, Steve January, Terry Galassini, Darrell Schoolcraft, Ray Smith, Gary Choquet, and David Roentsch regarding Tw's pressures and delivery capability at Socal Needles.\n\n19. Analysis indicates there is a pressure drop from our Needles measurement station to the Socal station across the river approximately two miles.\n\n20. Socal maintains that if we can give them psi at their station they can take the full MMBtu under the contract, which translates to psi at Tw's meter with our current situation.\n\n21. Our problem has been if we lose volume out of San Juan or a unit on the west of Thoreau leg then we lose line pack and then pressure at the border, but Socal acknowledges they have a motor out of service at Needles but plan to have it back on line in October.\n\n22. Operations has agreed to look at a number of things including changing the type of meter at Needles, looking at some station valve replacement, and mechanical condition of stations through marketing agreed to estimate the revenue impact of the pressure drop and lower volume delivery to help justify any capital expenditures."

It's great to hear that the latest modifications, including the display of actual bids along with evaluated bids on each detail line, have been moved into production and are ready for testing. I understand that these enhancements will allow shippers to see the actual bid rate for all bids greater than max rate and calculate winning bids based on evaluated bid and term only, ignoring the time entered in the first column. It's also clear that now, a bid being ignored means it is a potential winner, not an actual winner, encouraging shippers to bid on the full volume of the package. I appreciate your clarification on this point. Regarding the modification that prevents users from superseding any of their own bids greater than or equal to max rate, I understand the rationale behind introducing a high risk factor and postponing its implementation until after Friday's iOS update. This seems reasonable considering some of these modifications affect the ranking of bids. I look forward to the thorough testing by your marketing team before shippers are allowed to enter the system."

      "body": "Dear Team, \n\nI hope this message finds you well. I would like to discuss an important matter concerning our shared commitment to safety at work.\n\nOver the years, our team concept has brought about numerous opportunities for growth and improvements. We have celebrated accomplishments, built trust, and increased responsibilities as a team. However, a crucial aspect of this growth and maturity must include the realization and acceptance of our responsibility to monitor and enforce company policies and procedures.\n\nI have always emphasized that I will protect those who comply with and enforce our requirements. However, I have zero tolerance for those who choose not to do so. This year, several ETS employees received disciplinary action as a result of their failure to act or ignoring safe work practices. These cases were distributed to all employees in the form of a safety bulletin.\n\nI encourage everyone to learn from these instances to make our workplace even safer. I would like to share two examples from last year:\n\n1. After repeatedly counseling a fellow team member who was violating several safety requirements, including hard hat and safety glasses usage, the team took action which ultimately resulted in this person being discharged. This harsh outcome was preferable to the person injuring themselves or even worse, a fellow team member.\n\n2. Another team member chose to drive a company vehicle without using a seatbelt. The employee was involved in an accident, ejecting him from the vehicle and causing injuries that could have been prevented if the seat belt had been properly used. This employee is lucky to be alive. Using seat belts by all occupants of company vehicles is one of the most basic elements of our program and has been a requirement for over years.\n\nAs the use of seatbelts is habit-forming, it is possible that this may have been the first time the employee failed to use them. It is also possible that other team members had observed this failure in the past but did not act. Could this have been prevented through positive interaction? Had positive interaction been taken but ignored when the Declaration of Interdependence was introduced, we made a commitment to each other that we would be our brothers and sisters keeper and remind each other of the need to comply with safety requirements at all times.\n\nWhile some employees may feel uncomfortable enforcing our requirements, that does not relieve anyone from their responsibility. Likewise, a team is responsible and accountable for the actions or lack of required action of each team member. Each individual team member and the team as a whole are responsible for the outcome and any disciplinary action that management may be required to take.\n\nI urge everyone to help us create the safest work environment possible. Our most important personal goal should be to do whatever it takes to arrive home safely each and every night, and we should expect nothing less from peers or members of our leadership to hold us accountable for doing just that.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"

It's interesting to note that while the expansion is expected to be in the mmcf range, Williams plans to file an application with FERC to add additional dthd of firm transportation capacity from Wyoming to California markets. This proposed expansion, known as the California Expansion Project, could potentially pave the way for a second phase expansion. \n\nAccording to your email, the expansion is driven by rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power generation facilities in California. Kirk Morgan, Director of Business Development for Kern River and Northwest Pipeline, mentioned that Kern River is well-positioned to pursue an economically attractive expansion of its mainline. \n\nThe proposal includes adding three new compressor stations as well as boosting or retooling existing facilities in Wyoming and Utah. Williams also plans to upgrade two meter stations with an anticipated inservice date being May. \n\nBack in August, Kern River held an open season to determine interest in firm year-round gas transportation service in Nevada and California and to determine interest for capacity relinquishment by existing shippers. The pipeline landed a number of contracts providing for delivery of Rockies supply into California. \n\nIt seems that the demand for new capacity out of Wyoming is being driven by a shift in downstream markets for Canadian supply, strong economic growth in Kern market areas, and surging demand for gas-fired generation. Morgan mentioned that a ramp-up in Rockies production coupled with demand for competitive transportation promises a solid base for future expansion. \n\nExpansion on Kern River could help bring this production to market, as it currently delivers Rockies and Canadian supply to markets in California, Nevada, and Utah. Its design capacity is 1 billion cfd."

      "body": "Thank you for sharing the update regarding the hydrostatic test of the line and the necessary pipe replacement. I appreciate El Paso's transparency in providing the estimated project timeline, which extends through Sunday and reduces Bondad mainline capacity by 1 MMcfD affecting seven receipt points with the line out of service. It is concerning that the mmcfd loss cannot be made up at points downstream of the Bondad mainline, and El Paso's statement about the same not additional mmcfd reduction must be applied at Gallup NM station. \n\nRegarding the operational issue with the internet-based nomination system, it is good to know that El Paso Gas Transmission Northwest resolved the power failure on Thursday morning and the server is back online. \n\nLastly, I am looking forward to the meetings in Houston, Los Angeles, and Phoenix next week where El Paso will present details of its Line No project. I plan to attend one of these meetings and have reached out to Lisa Holmes at (800) 521-4737 or via email [lisa.holmes@epg.com](mailto:lisa.holmes@epg.com) for further details."

      "body": "Dear Valued Client,\n\nI am writing to inform you about some changes in our pipeline cleaning and internal inspection program. The smart pigging of the line between Eunice and Pecos River stations, originally scheduled for this Sunday, has been postponed one day. This will result in a reduction of MMcf/d flow through Eunice to the South Mainline, affecting deliveries to six interconnects, which unfortunately will not be able to deliver into El Paso for hours that day.\n\nAdditionally, another smart pigging of the line between Pecos River and Guadalupe stations, scheduled for November, has also been postponed one day. This requires a reduction of MMcf/d through the Pecos River line, which may affect deliveries to Maricopa. \n\nFurthermore, pigging of the line between Maricopa and Gallup stations is scheduled for November, reducing the line's capacity by MMcf/d and potentially affecting deliveries of San Juan gas to the Phoenix area.\n\nFinally, pigging of the line will be done in December, causing a MMcf/d allocation. This will affect points upstream of Bondad Mainline and Gallup.\n\nWe understand that these changes may cause inconvenience, however, we assure you that our team is working diligently to minimize any disruptions and complete the necessary maintenance as soon as possible.\n\nThank you for your understanding,\n[Your Name]"
